            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that his mind being wholly addicted unto honour, paſtime, and worldly pleaſure, he preſumed to bear the countenance of an high and coſtly eſtate, by uſual frequenting of Princes Courts, Iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp; other ſuch-like Martial games, by which means he ſoon waſted much of his goods and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. His friends being greatly diſpleaſed with ſuch his outragious prodigality, determined to marry him unto a Wife; ſuppoſing thereby ſomewhat to alter his mind. <hi>Theodorus</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly condeſcended to their deſires: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151308:4"/> they diligently ſearching to find out a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and convenient Eſpouſe for him, found at length in the City of <hi>Nicova</hi> (which is the Head City of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where there Kings commonly keep their Courts) a Noble and Rich Citizen which had a fair Daughter named <hi>Gratiana,</hi> whom he forthwith was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to give in Marriage unto <hi>Theodorus,</hi> without any further inquiry what manner of man he was. And thereupon was the Maiden brought home unto him, only upon the great Fame of his Riches and Puiſſance; who was at her Comming entertained with a Coſtly and Sumptuous Banquet, as the manner is of the Rich, to ſhew at ſuch times their Wealth and Magnificence.</p>
            <p>After the Feaſt was ended, all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly finiſhed, and every Gueſt taking their leave were returned home, <hi>Theodorus</hi> taking his Eſpouſe unto him, lived for a ſeaſon friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vertuouſly with her; wherewith both ſhe and her friends took great pleaſure, thinking they had atchieved a very good deed, in ſo taming the wild <hi>Theodorus,</hi> by tying him to a Wife: but yet they conſidered not the property of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which bendeth only to that which ſhe is inclined unto.

Then in Selling, Gaging, and Waſting, he continued ſo long till all was gone: and ſo fell into ſuch extream poverty, that he was neither able to keep Man-ſervant nor Maiden: So the good <hi>Gratiana</hi> was of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty forced to dreſs her own Meat, and to waſh her own Cloaths like a Hand-maid or poor ſlave. They on a time ſitting together at a ſimple Dinner, pretending to make good chear if they had wherewithal, the Father beholding his Son, ſighed from the bottom of his Heart: which when his Son perceived, who was then eighteen Years Old, and could Write and Read, ſimply (but was expert in Praying on the Lute, in Hunting and Hawking, which were his chief Paſtimes) he ſaid to his Father: Dear Father, what a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then anſwered the Father, ſaying: My dear Son, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

In the World by hardy adventuring, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to many good chance and fortune, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I doubt not but by the help of God, ſome part ſhall fall to my Lot. As for you Father, you have buſineſs of the Kings, him may you ſerve, and it is not like that he will ſuffer you or my Mother long to continue in any great want. Leave off therefore (I ſay again) theſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151308:5"/> tears on my behalf: For I have not been ſo ill trained up (I thank God and you for it) but I can ſhift for my ſelf. With this went <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> out of the houſe with a Hawk on his Fiſt, toward the Sea-coaſt, pondering with himſelf what he might beſt do, to abſent himſelf from his Fathers ſight, that he might be no more grieved thereby. As he thus walked up and down by the Sea-ſide, he ſaw a Galley of <hi>Venice</hi> coming from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> wherein was an Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who had loſt two of his Men by the way. But foraſmuch as the Earl had no buſineſs with the King, and that the Patron of the Galley cauſed a Sign to be given by the ſound of a Trumpet, that every one ſhould ſpeedily come aboard the Ship, the Earl with many other Gentlemen came forthwith into the Galley: Which <hi>Fortunatus</hi> ſeeing, he thought in his mind: Would God I might be one of this great Lords men, to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him into his Country, that I might be rid of my Country <hi>Cyprus.</hi> With that he ſtepped boldly to the Earl, making low obeiſance and courteſie; (whereby the Earl well perceived that he was no Ruſtical Clown;) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal ſaid: Gracious Lord, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your Honour hath loſt two of your Men, and therefore pleaſeth you now to entertain one? Then asked the Earl: What canſt thou do? He anſwered, I can Hunt and Hawk, and do all that pertaineth thereto: I have alſo ſome skill in riding and Feats of Arms. To this,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151308:6"/> ſaid the Earl, thou ſhouldſt like me well: but to my Country we have a long and tedious journey, wherefore I ſuppoſe thou wauldſt be loth to travel ſo far. Not ſo, my Lord ſaid <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus,</hi> that ſhall be to me no let at all, but I would willingly adventure the travel, though it were four times as far. Then demanded the Earl, ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing: What Wages ſhall I give thee? <hi>Fortunatus</hi> anſwered, I require no wages, (if it ſo like your honour) but to be rewarded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my deſerts Theſe words of the young man liked the Earl very well, ſaying unto him: The Galley forthwith ſhall be lanched from the ſhore, art thou therefore ready to depart with us? He anſwered, When it pleaſeth you my Lord.

               <hi>Fortunatus</hi> perceiving his Lords good affection towards him, became the more ſerviceable, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf to be always in the Evening the laſt, and in the morning the firſt in his Lords preſence. Now the Earl had bought many Horſes for his ſervants, of the which ſome were haply more fair to the eye, than fit for any good purpoſe: He therefore would have them muſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him, and ſo diſtributed them among his men, giving to <hi>Fortunatus</hi> one next the beſt; which grieved much the other Servants, and thereupon they envyed him, ſaying among themſelves: What Devil hath ſent this <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> to put us out of conceit and credit?

            <p>The Nobles likewiſe, and other his friendly neighbors came together to welcome him, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God for his proſperous journey: &amp; before all other matters they took ſpecial care for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent accompliſhing of the wedding, which pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him very well: So that with full conſent he was Eſpouſed with all convenient ſpeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

When <hi>Fortunatus</hi> heard that, he took no great deliberation, but accepted the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge with a valiant courage. This being noiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Lords, they gladly drew together to ſee this bickering. The challenger &amp; defender each of them well appointed came to the Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, where they encountred with a manly and violent courage, being on either part ſtirred with a fervent deſire both of lucre and fame. At the fourth courſe <hi>Fortunatus</hi> hoiſed <hi>Timothy</hi> from his Horſe the ſpace of a Spears length: wherewith he won the victory, and obtained the Iewels, eſteemed more worth than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns. By this was the envy of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants more vehemently increaſed, but the Earl himſelf rejoyced greatly, that one of his retinue had ſo victoriouſly won the chief Prize. Howbeit he underſtood not the Grudge and Malice that his men had againſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151308:9"/> 
               <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> neither durſt any man diſcloſe it unto him.</p>
            <p>Among the Earls Servants there was one, an old wiſe fellow, named <hi>Robert,</hi> who offered himſelf to practiſe a caſt of knavery in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all his fellows, promiſing unto them, that if they would give unto him ten Crowns in ready money, he would bring to paſs that the Italian ſhould depart of his own accord, without taking leave of his Lord, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that none thereof ſhould be ſuſpected. Then ſaid his fellows, <hi>If thou canſt do as thou haſt ſaid, why doſt thou linger any ſtay to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the ſame?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>Soft a while, for I cannot do it without preſent money; but if every one of you will give me half a Crown, I will repay unto each of you a whole Crown, if I work not this feat according as I have ſaid.</hi> They were all willing to grant to his requeſt, ſo that they ſpeedily collected this ſum of fifteen Crowns, and gave them to <hi>Robert,</hi> who willed them to ſpeak no more unto him concerning that matter, and that every one ſhould behave himſelf according as he had done before. From henceforth this <hi>Robert</hi> became a daily compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion unto <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> ſhewing himſelf very friendly unto him, inveagling him with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant communication, and recounting of things done in the Countrey, which was to <hi>Fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> delectable. He enured and enticed him to the company and haunt of fair women, where he of his proper charges, would always ſend
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151308:9"/> for Wine and other Banquetting Iunquets, meet for ſuch company. <hi>Robert</hi> alſo would col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne with him, praiſing his Riches, Nobility, and valiant courage, which <hi>Fortunatus</hi> could well endure. And when he would always offer his money alſo for their expences, <hi>Robert</hi> would not ſuffer him to pay any part; ſaying, that he loved him better than any of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and therefore thought all too little that was beſtowed on him. This Company of good fellowſhip continued ſo long, that their fellows were therewith grieved: ſaying one to another, <hi>Doth Robert mean to drive away Fortunatus with ſuch a life? It is rather to be ſuppoſed that if he were in Cyprus again, and wiſt to have ſuch pleaſant entertainment, he would think it long ere he were returned thither: ſurely he doth not fulfil his promiſe, and therefore it is meet that we have our money again. Robert</hi> being advertiſed thereof, ſcoffed thus at his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, ſaying, <hi>Would they have me make better chear with their money than I have done?</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding at the laſt, when the money was near hand ſpent, on an evening when the Earl and his Wife were gone to reſt, cometh <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> to <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> into his Chamber ſecretly, and ſaid, <hi>Even now hath the Maſter Chancellor told me a ſecret, for he is my ſingular good friend, and did earneſtly forbid me upon pain to loſe his friendſhip, that I ſhould diſcloſe it to no man; but yet I cannot for the friendſhip that is between us, conceal
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151308:10"/> this thing from thee, which ſo nearly toucheth thine eſtate. Thus ſtands the cauſe (as thou knoweſt) our Lord hath a fair woman to Wife, and hath many fair Gentlewomen with her: He hath of late conceived a durable Fantaſie, and is become very jealous in the behalf of his Eſpouſe, and the other Gentlewomen, fearing leſt his young Chamberlains might be on them enamoured, and ſo provoked to Carnal Luſt; and although he dare repoſe ſuch confidence in them, that they would conſent to no diſhoneſty, yet can he not well put out of his mind what a blind thing Love is, and when it is once kindled, how hardly it is quenched, and that when true Lovers be linked with like Affections, nothing may ſeparate them but only Death.

And whileſt he remaineth there, he will cauſe the four Chamberlains to be Gelded whether they will or not, and then ſet them in their Office as before. He will alſo ſhew the matter unto his Wife, forbidding her to diſcloſe it unto any perſon. Howbeit he knoweth well that ſhe cannot long conceal it from her waiting Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, who will moſt likely utter it further
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151308:10"/> unto others, ſo ſhall it paſs from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther until it be ſpread all abroad. And by this means he pretendeth to prevent all Miſchief that eft-ſoons might chance among you through Amorous Love; for he conſidereth that no woman regardeth a gelded man.</hi> When <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus</hi> had heard this report, he was therewith amazed; and firſt of all asked him whether he knew any ſecret way whereby he might convey himſelf with ſpeed out of the City? ſaying, I will not in any caſe abide the preſence of my Lord, though he would give me all his Lands; no, though he would make me King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would I ſerve him any longer: I pray thée therefore ſaid <hi>Fortunatus</hi> help me, my good friend <hi>Robert,</hi> and give me ſome counſel how I may ſpeedily depart. <hi>Robert</hi> anſwered, ſaying; <hi>Thou knoweſt all the Gates of the City be now ſhut, and none can iſſue out or in, until to morrow when the Bell warneth to ſervice, and then is the Cow-gate opened. But my beloved <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> if I my ſelf were in your caſe, I would not greatly refuſe it, conſidering the great Love and Affection that thy Lord hath conceived toward thee, whereby thou art like to come to great preferment,</hi> Then ſaid <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> I would rather become a begger, to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as a vagabond from place to place, than to endure ſuch a ſhame and villany. Then ſpake <hi>Robert</hi> again, ſaying, <hi>I am now ſorry that ever I advertiſed thee of theſe things, ſithence thou wilt ſo depart: For I truſt we ſhould have lived
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151308:11"/> together in friendly amity, as loving brethren, and to have paſſed our time joyfully, one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in the other. But ſithence thou wilt by no means here longer remain, let me yet be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by Letters from thee, where thou art become, that when our Lord ſhall be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided of gelded men to his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, I may write to thee, that thou mayſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair hither again: for I doubt not but at any time thou ſhalt have entertainment of the Earl:</hi> to this anſwered <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>You ſhall little need either to write or ſend unto me, for ſo long as I live I mean not to come to this court any more. And therefore I inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thee not to diſcloſe my departure, until I have been three days away:</hi> which thing <hi>Robert</hi> promiſed him, and ſo he took his leave of him, making ſemblance as though he were very ſorry: Thus this traiterous <hi>Judas</hi> wrought this knaviſh device.

So paſſing all the night in fear and grief, at the break of day he took his journey on Horſe-back with Hounds following him as though he had pretended to Hunt, and rode ſo ſwiftly, that if one of his eyes had fallen out of his head he would ſcantly have ſtayed to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>WHen <hi>Fortunatus</hi> had ridden ten miles, he bought another horſe, and ſent back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto the Earl, his Horſe and his Hounds, that he might have no occaſion to purſue after him. When the Earl underſtood that <hi>Fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> had departed without leave, foraſmuch as he knew of no cauſe whereat he might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, neither had paid him his wages, he greatly marvelled, and thereupon demanded of all his ſervants generally and particularly, whether they knew any occaſion of his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They all denyed that they wiſt thereof, and took their Oaths that they had not by any means to their knowledge grieved him. Then went the Earl to the Ladies &amp; Gentlewomen, requiring likewiſe of them, whether they had moved him to any diſpleaſure, or whether they miſdeemed any cauſe of his going away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave. The Counteſs and all the other Gentlewomen anſwered, that they wiſt not of any thing that might offend him either by word or deed: but that in the Evening before his departure he was exceeding merry and pleaſant: reporting unto them of the attire of Women, and of many other Vſages and Cuſtomes of his Country, and that in ſuch corrupt language, as we could not refrain from Laughing, and he himſelf Laughing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151308:12"/> with us alſo; and ſo with no worſe countenance he left our company. Then ſaid the Earl, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the cauſe of his flight be now concealed from me, I doubt not but hereafter I ſhall be advertiſed thereof: and verily if I ſhall know that any of mine was the occaſion of it, I ſhall be ſharply revenged on him; for I know that <hi>Fortunatus</hi> is not fled without ſome great cauſe. I am ſure that he hath gotten about 500 Crowns whilſt he hath been here: and I had thought he would not have departed hence du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his live.

So he went to <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> where was great reſort, enquiring who was deſtitute of a Servant? There was a rich Merchant of <hi>Florence,</hi> that retained many Servants, who he ſet at work in his Traffick, of him was <hi>Fortunatus</hi> hired for two Crowns a Month, which liked him well. Being Entertained, he was brought Home to his Maſter, named <hi>Jeronimus Roberti,</hi> whom he ſerved at the Table very handſomly; whereby he perceived that <hi>Fortunatus</hi> had been well trained up in civil company: ſo that in proceſs of time, he ſent him to Beſtow the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize into the Ships, and to receive other that came into the Realm, in which Affairs he behaved himſelf very well. About the time when <hi>Fortunatus</hi> ſerved <hi>Jeronimus Roberti,</hi> there was a <hi>Florentine</hi> named <hi>Andrew,</hi> the Son of a rich Merchant, to whom his Father had given much Goods, and ſent him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftily in ſhort time conſumed: And being therewith not ſatisfied, took up alſo more Money by Bills of Exchange, making his Father believe that he would ſend him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rich Merchandizes.

His friends ſéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little to regard his miſery, but willed him to go to the King or his Counſel, and ſhew them thereof, for he went on the Kings ſervice. When he came to the Court, and could have no redreſs in the matter, he heard ſay the King of <hi>England</hi> had eſpouſed his Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and that thither he meant preſently to ſend certain Iewels of great price, the carriage whereof he had committed to a certain Gentleman which had Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren reſident in <hi>London.</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151308:16"/> faculty, I have travelled ſo far, in hope the King would buy ſome of me. The plain-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentleman ſaid unto him, ſtay here a while till I be diſpatched, and then ſhall you go with me, where I will ſhew them unto you. Anon after he came again to <hi>Andrew</hi> and took him home to his Houſe, being then Dinner-time: Wherefore he ſaid, we will firſt Dine, leſt my Wife be diſpleaſed. So receiving of him Courteous Entertainment, when Dinner was done, he carried him to his Chamber, and there opening a fair Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, brought out of it a Coffer, wherein were the Iewels which he willee him to view at his pleaſure. The Iewels were very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, amounting to the valud of threeſcore Thouſand Crowns, and the more one beheld them, the fairer they ſeemed. <hi>Andrew</hi> praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them greatly, and ſaid, I have yet ſome, that if they were as well ſet as theſe be, would no doubt diſgrace ſome of theſe. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman liked this well, thinking with himſelf, if he have ſo coſtly Iewels, the King will yet ſurely beſtow more money. <hi>Andrew</hi> ſaid, to morrow ſhall you dine with me, in <hi>Jeronimus Roberty</hi> his houſe, where I will ſhew you my Iewels. This liked the Gentleman well. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> went incontinently to <hi>Jeronimus Roberti,</hi> and ſaid, I have found out a man in the Court, who I truſt will aſſiſt me to deliver the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that you ſhould have good ſuretiſhip in the Kings cuſtom-houſe.

The next day brought <hi>Andrew</hi> the Man with him; but before they ſat down at the board, he privily warned <hi>Jeronimus,</hi> that he ſhould not find much talk of the Priſoner, for the matter muſt be ſecretly conveyed. They ſat down to their meat and were merry, and lingred ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long, but <hi>Jeronimus</hi> roſe from the board, and went into his ſtudy: at the laſt ſaid <hi>Andrew</hi> to the Gentleman, come you up with me into my Chamber, and I will ſhew you my Iewels. So they went up together into a Chamber that was over the Hall where whey dined, and there <hi>Andrew</hi> making an offer, as though he would have opened a great Coffer, drew his Knife privily, and ſticked the Gentleman that he ſunk down, and therewith ſtepped unto him and cut his throat. That done, he took from his thumb a gold King, wherein his Seal was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and took his Keys from his girdle, and ſo ran ſwiftly to the Gentlemans Houſe, and ſaid to his Wife, Miſtris, your husband hath ſent me unto you, willing you to ſend him the Iewels which he ſhewed me yeſterday, and for a token of truth doth he ſend you here his King and the Keys of his Armory.

Be ſtill therefore and make no out-cry, I will caſt the carcaſs into the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and if any enquiry be made for him, ſay ye, ſoon after dinner he departed, and ſince that we ſaw him not.

The ſame day that the murther was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, came <hi>Fortunatus</hi> home to <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>Sandwich,</hi> where he had laden certain Wares of his Maſters into a ſhip. And when he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was not ſo joyfully welcome as he was wont, and that his Maſter, his companions, and the reſt of the houſhold were not ſo merry as he had left them, he muſed greatly, and thereupon demanded of the chief Maiden, what had chanced in his abſence, that they all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151308:18"/> ſhewed ſuch heavy countenance. The diſcreet houſewife which her Maſter loved well, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, be not thou troubled <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> for our Maſter hath received Letters from <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> that one of his dear Friends is dead, whom he ſo intirely loved as his own Brother? howbeit he was not ſo near of Kin, that it ſhould be requiſite to wear Mourning Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for him. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> hearing this, made no more ado, but ſeemed alſo to be ſorry with them. Now the Gentlemans Wife foraſmuch as her Husband came not home, neither ſent any word to ſhew the cauſe of that ſtay, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled much, and that night quieted her ſelf: But in the morning ſpeedily ſhe ſent one of her friends to the Court to enquire whether her Husband were there, or that the King had ſent him any other way. When the Kings Counſel heard that enquiry was made for him, they wondred that he appeared not in the Court. And when the King alſo was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified hereof, he commanded a Meſſenger forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to go to his houſe, and to ſee whether he were there, and had the Iewels about him. For the King ſomewhat miſdeemed of the matter, fearing leſt peradventure he were gone clean away with the Iewels: and though he ſuppoſed him to be an Honeſt man, yet thought he it not unlikely that he might be tempted with the great value of his Charge. So when every man had asked each of other, and no man could give certain reſolution

When the Woman was asked for her Husband and for the Iewels, and what he ſaid at his departure?

The Meſſenger moreover ſignified unto me, that he was in the Houſe of <hi>Jeronimus Roberti,</hi> where were (as he ſaid) many Iewels alſo, and that he would confer the one ſort with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So I led him into the Chamber, and with thoſe Keys opened the Armory, but the Iewels could we by no means find, ſo that the man returned unwillingly without them. Then demanded they of her, whether he had any ſeveral places of cuſtody? She anſwered: none: For all the chiefeſt things whereof he maketh account, as Déeds, Letters, Seals, and ſuch like, doth he lay up in the Armony. The Iewels were once there alſo, but none at that time, for if they had, I would have ſent them unto him. The ſearchers hearing this, brake up all the Coffers, Cheſts, and Cupboards in the houſe, and yet the Iewels could they not find: whereat the Kings Meſſengers were greatly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151308:19"/> aſtonied, and the Gentlewoman exceedingly amazed to ſée her houſe ſo miſuſed. When this was told the King, it grieved him more for the Iewels, than for the money that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them; For that although he had money enough at will, yet he could not have the like Iewels at his pleaſure. The King and his Counſel being in this perplexity, wiſt not what was beſt to do, but in the end concluded to apprehend <hi>Jeronimus Roberti</hi> with all his Family, that they ſhould give an account what was become of the man; which was ſo done the fifh day after the Gentleman was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. So the Sheriff waiting till ſuppertime, entred the houſe, where he found them all together: Namely, the two Maſters, the two Servants of Accounts, a Cook, a Horſe-kéeper, two Maidens, and <hi>Fortunatus.</hi> So that there were in the whole nine Perſons, which were all brought to Priſon, and placed every one apart from the other, and examined whether the two men were become? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all alike, that preſently after Dinner they went their way, and ſithence that they never ſaw nor heard of them. But the Sheriff not therewith content, took all the keys of the Houſe, and narrowly ſearched the Stables, Cellers, and Ware-houſes, where they might have buried the man, and yet found him not. But as they were departing, one amongſt the Searchers, who had a burning Torch in his hand, ſetting therewithal on fire a handful of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151308:19"/> ſtraw, caſt it into the privy, and ſo lookfng down, eſpied the dead body with the Legs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and therewith cried, Alas for pitty the man lyeth here murthered in the privy. Then drew they him out, being filthy and loathſom, and laid him openly before <hi>Jeronimus Roberty</hi> his door. When the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of this hainous murther, they made ſuch an outcry upon the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Lumbards,</hi> that they were fain to keep them cloſe in their Houſes, leſt if they were ſéen abroad, they ſhould be beaten down by the people.</p>
            <p>This tydings was ſpéedily brought to the King, who commanded to rack the Maſter and all the reſt, whereby the Truth might be boulted out, and that their confeſſions ſhould be ſeverally written, and eſpecially concerning the Iewels. So the Executioner firſt racked <hi>Jeronimus</hi> very grievouſly, enticing him therewithal, to manifeſt who committed the murther, and where the Iewels were beſtowed? <hi>Jeronimus</hi> perceiving by the extream pain he was put to, that the King and his Officers had intelligence of the murther committed in the Houſe, without his knowledge or conſent, therefore he was excéeding ſorry. And when he ſaw there was no remedy but patience, he declared how every thing had happened, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that one <hi>Andrew</hi> had required him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a coſtly dinner, ſignifying that he ſhould bring a Gentleman to dinner with him, whom he had procured to aſſiſt him to deliver a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151308:20"/> that was in <hi>Turn</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which thing (ſaid he) I did for the honour of the King, and the whole Realm, neither wiſt I of any thing elſe. Now when dinner was done, I took no regard of them, but went to my ſtudy to write; and when I had done, coming forth again, I eſpied blood dropping from the Chamber above, into the Hall; whereat I being aſtonied, ſent my ſervant to ſee what it ſhould be, who ſhewed me as it was. And as it happened, at that very inſtant came in this Varlet <hi>Andrew,</hi> to whoſe charge I laid this murder, who anſwered, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other would have murthered me, but by Gods help I prevented his pretence, and flew him, and ſo caſt him into the Privy: and therewith he ſuddenly fled, and where he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come I wot not. The very ſame in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect did all the other affirm, when they were all racked. But <hi>Fortunatus</hi> confeſſed nothing, though he were racked likewiſe; for he was not in the houſe when this miſchief betided, and therefore was clean ignorant of the matter.</p>

When the Cook (who was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man) laſt of all ſaw <hi>Fortunatus</hi> ſhould be executed, he cried with a loud voice, and declared before all the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151308:21"/> people, that <hi>Fortunatus</hi> was altogether inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and knowing nothing of the matter.

Wherefore he cauſed to be publiſhed, that who could bring the firſt tydings of them, ſhould for a reward have five hundred marks: This was alſo proclaimed in other Nations, and Letters were written to many Princes and Lords of ſtrange Countries, that if any came to ſell ſuch Iewels, they ſhould be ſtaid, and tydings ſent thereof: Howbeit there was no news heard of them, although every man would gladly have done therein what lay in his power, only to have gained the reward.</p>
            <p>Thus paſſed the time, till the Gentlewoman did Solemnize the Funeral Exequies of her Husband at the months end. And when the time of Chief Mourning was over-paſſed, invited her Play-fellows, Goſſips, and Neighbours to make good chear with her; Amongſt whom was one that lately alſo had loſt her Husband, who ſaid, If you will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my Advice, I will teach you how you ſhall ſoon forget the Death of your Husband. Make your bed in another Chamber: or if you liſt not ſo to do, remove it from one place to another, and when you go to bed, call to your mind ſome luſty Young man, whom you would wiſh to be your Husband, and ſay to your ſelf, the Dead with the Dead, and the Living with the Living; for ſo did I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Husbands death. Then ſaid the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, Alas good Play-fellow, but I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151308:22"/> loved my Husband ſo well, and with ſo good affection, that I cannot forget him ſo ſoon. Howbeit, earneſtly imprinted the words in her mind: And ſo ſoon as the Company was gone, ſhe began to remove the bedſteds, cheſts, and Coffers, ſo that unawares by one of the beds-feet ſhe found a little coffer wherein were the Iewels: which the Gentlewoman well knowing, ſet aſide for a while, and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs continued her moving till ſhe had done. After that ſhe ſent for one of her Kinſmen, to whom ſhe declared that ſhe had found the Kings Iewels by chance, and that if ſhe had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Bed, they might have layen long enough there unknown, for that none would have ſought in ſuch a place for them. So ſhe required his Advice how ſhe might beſtow them. Who hearing that the Iewels were luckly found, greatly rejoyced, and ſaid to her: If you deſire my counſel in this caſe, and will accept well thereof, I would wiſh you thus to do: Take the Iewels, and I will go with you to make means to ſpeak with the King himſelf, and to deliver the Iewels into his own hands, and alſo you ſhall ſhew him the plain truth, by what chance you found them, referring to his courteſie what reward he will give you; for if the Iewels ſhould be cloſely imbeſeled from the King, it behoveth to carry them into a ſtrange Country to be ſold, where I warrant you he will lay privy wait if any ſuch be offered to the Iewellers, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151308:22"/> then the King being advertiſed thereof, all them that have had to do with them, might loſe both Body and Goods, and the Iewels notwithſtanding ſhould be reſtored to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>This Counſel liked the Woman very well, and ſo decking her ſelf comely in Widows at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, went with her kinſman to the Court, there making earneſt ſuit to ſpeak with the King himſelf. The King being advertiſed thereof, ſhe was admitted in his preſence in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of State. When ſhe came before the King, ſhe humbly on her knees ſaid; Moſt gracious Lord, I your poor Hand-maid, am come to ſignifie unto your Majeſty, that the Iewels which were committed unto my Husband your ſervant, to be delivered unto the Dutches of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> are found this day under a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, as I by chance removed my Bed, and ſo preſently with all ſpeed I have made haſt to preſent the ſame unto your Majeſty. The King forthwith opened the Coffer, and found all the Iewels as they ought to be, whereof he was exceeding glad, and ſo delivered them into the Iewel-houſe to be kept. The King alſo conceived very well of her diligence, for that ſhe would not hazard them on the credit of any other, but delivered them with her own hands: And foraſmuch alſo as through occaſion of the Iewels ſhe had loſt her Husband, he thought in reaſon that ſhe ſhould by ſome means or other be recompenced with a ſpecial reward,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:151308:23"/> whereby her ſorrow might be ſomewhat dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: wherefore he cauſed a certain luſty and couragious Young Gentleman of the Court to be called unto him, to whom he ſaid, I will now requeſt of thee a thing, which I truſt thou wilt not deny me. The young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman anſwered, ſaying, Gracious Lord, you ſhall not uſe ſuch entreaty, but command me what liketh you, and I will be obedient. With that the King forthwith ſent for a Chaplain, and even in his preſence did he marry theſe two together, and beſtowed on them rich gifts, who lived joyfully one with the other. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman anon after went to her Play-fellow and thanked her greatly for the councel which ſhe gave her to remove her bedſted, which, ſaid ſhe, if I had not done, the King had not enjoyed his Iewels again, neither had I gotten ſuch a fair and luſty young man to my Husband.

As he ſat him down by this fountain (the moon ſhining clear) he heard a noiſe in the Wood, as if it had béen the grunting of Bears: Wherefore he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred his ſtumps, and conveyed himſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aſide out of ſight; and therewithal deviſing how he might beſt ſhift to be ſafe from the force of the Wild-Beaſts, he climbed upon a Tree-well freighted with boughs, not far from the

            <p>THe Servant returned with his anſwer to the Earl; who being informed that he was no gentleman, commanded his men in a great rage to lay hands on him; ſaying, that he had ſurely committed ſome great Robery, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſome man. The ſervants executed his Commandment, and encloſed him in a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Priſon, asking from whence, and what he was?</p>
            <p>He anſwered, I was born in a Town of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> called <hi>Famagoſta,</hi> and I am the Son of a poor Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Then asked the Earl by what means he got ſo much money? He ſaid, My money is my own, truly gotten, and therefore I truſt your honour will not rigorouſly enforce me to recount from whence I had it: but if any man can prove or ſay that I have done wrong to any creature, or come untruly by it, I ſhall willingly ſtand to thy Law and mercy. To this, ſaid the Earl, thy prating will not avail thee; but thou ſhalt ere thou depart confeſs from whence and how thou haſt obtained this money: with that cauſed they him to be brought to the rack; when <hi>Fortunatus</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:151308:32"/> ſaw how extreamly he ſhould be dealt withal, he was ſore afraid, howbeit he purpoſed rather to die, than to open the ſecret Vertues of his Purſe. But when he was Racked, and felt the grievous pangs and torments thereof, he cryed to them to unloſe him, and promiſed to utter whatſoever they would ask. Then being again demanded how he came by ſo many fair Crowns? He ſaid: After I had wandred three days long in the Wood, and with much ado at length came out into the fields, I found a Purſe wherein were ſix Hundred and Ten Crowns. Then asked the Earl where is that Purſe? <hi>Fortunatus</hi> ſaid, When I had told the Money, I put it in my own bag, and caſt the Purſe into the River that runneth by the Wood. The Earl ſaid, Thou Varlet wilt thou rob me of that is mine? Thou ſhalt well underſtand that both thy Body and Goods are forfeited unto me, foraſmuch as whatſoever is in the Wood is mine own. Then ſaid <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus,</hi> Gracious Lord, I wiſt not of your Iuriſdiction therein, for I thanked God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and eſteemed it as a Gift. And think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou, ſaid the Earl, this to be ſufficient excuſe for thee? Didſt thou never hear ſay, <hi>That he which is ignorant muſt ask?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſhort, prepare thy ſelf, for to Day will I take from thee thy Goods, and to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thy Life. Then thought <hi>Fortunatus</hi> with himſelf, miſerable wretch that I am, how uncircumſpect was I, having the free Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:151308:32"/> on ſix Gifts, that I choſe not Wiſdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt, for then I had not fallen into this danger and thraldom. And then he craved for mercy, ſaying: O gracious Lord, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the poor wandring wight, and ſeek not my death, which will nothing avail you: take unto you the goods found, which be yours, and ſpare me my life which God hath lent me, and I will evermore pray truely for your good eſtate.</p>
            <p>The Earl was very loath to pardon him, becauſe he feared leſt he might make ill report of his rigour where he ſhould become, which might turn to his reproach among other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſtate, they hearing thereof. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he being moved to mercy, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his men, granted him his Life, but bereft him of all his goods, ſaving only the Harnaſs, which he rendred to him again, with a Crown alſo in his Purſe.</p>
            <p>The Earl moreover in the morning before day commanded his Men to bring him without the Town, and there to take an Oath of him, that he ſhould never again come into his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, ſo long as he lived. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> inwardly rejoyced, that he had ſo well eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, for if the Earl had but known the truth, moſt likely he had been bereft of his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Purſe. After this came <hi>Fortunatus</hi> to <hi>Angiers,</hi> which is the chief Town of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> ſcituated by the Sea-Coaſt, where were

Of this was <hi>Fortunatus</hi> very glad: and being deſirous to advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among them, thought thus with himſelf, if I ſhould do in all points as I might if I liſt, peradventure I ſhould be ſerved as I was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Earl.</p>
            <p>Howbeit he adventured yet once again to buy three fair horſes with coſtly furniture, and hired two ſervants, cloathing both them, and himſelf preſently in trim apparel, and ſo lodged in the beſt Inn of <hi>Angiers,</hi> there meaning to wait the Dutches coming, and to receive her in the Company of other Gentlemen.

               <hi>Leopoldus</hi> thought with himſelf, this young man promiſeth me very much, and if he be able to perform it accordingly, it falleth out luckily for me in my old age: and therewith ſaid to <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> I am content to grant your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſo far as you accompliſh your promiſe.

So at his coming he preſented the Abbot with a Veſſel of the beſt Wine he could get. The Abbot yielded unto him great Thanks, for in that Country they ſeldome uſe any Wine, except it be in Miniſtring the Sacrament. When the Dinner was finiſhed, <hi>Fortunatus</hi> ſaid unto the Abbot. May it pleaſe your Honour to let me underſtand upon what occaſion this Hole firſt was named St. <hi>Patricks</hi> Purgatory? The Abbot anſwered, ſaying: Many hundred Years ſithence was this Town and this Abby a Deſolate Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and not far from it dwelt an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot called <hi>Patrick,</hi> who was a very Devout Man. He oftentimes reſorting to this Deſart, to do ſome work of penance, one day by chance found this long and deep Hole, into the which he went ſo far, that he could not return. With that he fell on his knees, praying unto God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, that (if it were his pleaſure) he would
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151308:37"/> deliver him out of that dark dungeon: whileſt he thus devoutly prayed, it ſeemed to him that he heard yet further of a piteous cry. In the mean while ſuddenly he was delivered out of the Hole: Wherefore he joyfully Praiſing the Lord for his mercy, went again into the Cloiſter, and became more devout than ever he was before. And ſo in perpetual memory of this chance, was this Abby builded by devout men. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> then asked farther what the Pilgrims reported that came thence out again? The Abbot ſaid, I ſeldom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them: but ſome ſay, they have heard a pittiful ſcreeking: others report they have neither ſeen nor heard any thing at all, but that they have been ſore afraid. Then ſaid <hi>Fortunatus:</hi> I am come from far Countries to this place, and if I ſhould return home without ſome certain Trial of ſuch a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my own Perſon, it ſhould be a reproach to me: therefore will I not go hence till I have been in the Hole. Then ſaid the Abbot, If you will needs adventure, beware you go not too far in, for there be many by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wherein you may go aſtray, as many others have done in my time, which have not been found till three days after. <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> asked of <hi>Leopoldus</hi> whether he would adventure in with him? He ſaid: Yea, I will go into any place with you ſo long as God ſpares me Life. That liked <hi>Fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> well: Whereupon they receiving the holy

            <p>Thus they not knowing how to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and being very hungry and faint, they wholly deſpaired of all ſuccour, &amp; dreaded their lives, they ſat down as men forlorn, neither hearing nor ſeeing any thing at all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with made their humble prayers unto God; Saying: <hi>Almighty Lord, aſſiſt us with thy Power, by ſome means or other, for in this loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Den, neither Silver nor Gold can ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, though we have it at will, but in thee only is our truſt.</hi> The Prieſt in the mean while ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified unto the Abbot, that the Pilgrims were not as yet come out again, whereof he was very ſorry; eſpecially becauſe of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus,</hi> who had preſented him ſo liberally. The Servants alſo at the Door watched continually, and greatly lamented for their Maſters: But the Abbot notwithſtanding remembred himſelf of an old Man, who many years before had meaſured the Hole with a Cord, for him he ſent, and requeſted him to try whether he could bring forth the men. The Servants alſo promiſed him an hundred Crowns for his pains. The old man
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:151308:38"/> ſaid if they be yet alive, I ſhall ſure bring them forth; and therewith prepared a muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, played on it, and ſo paſſed from one hole to the other, until he had found them, being very feeble and faint; whom he willed to take hold of him, and ſo follow the ſound of his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the blind followeth his guide. So by the help of God, and the old mans aſſiſtance came they again to the light, whereof the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot was very glad: for he feared if thoſe two Pilgrims had been loſt, that no more would have reſorted thither, whereby he and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſhould fare the worſe. The men alſo told <hi>Fortunatus</hi> that they had promiſed an hundred Crowns to the old men for ſearching them out, which he forthwith deliver'd with great thanks. He ordained alſo a ſumptuous dinner, whereto he invited the Abbot and his brethren, thanking God for his deliverance out of ſo great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He gave alſo unto them for a Farewel, five hundred Crowns, to the intent they ſhould pray for his proſperous ſucceſs. Then took they their leave of the Abbot, and ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to accompliſh their purpoſed journey, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled back the next way to <hi>Callis,</hi> and from thence to St. <hi>Joſs</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> and ſo by <hi>Paris,</hi> through <hi>France, Spain, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Venice.</hi>

            <p>WHen they were come to <hi>Venice,</hi> they heard ſay that the Emperor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> would have his Son Crowned Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; and for that he was himſelf very old, he would yield up unto him the whole Authority and juriſdiction of the Empire, for the term of both their lives: whereupon the <hi>Venetians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a worſhipful Embaſſador to paſs to the young Emperor in a Galley, and to deliver un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him certain jewels ſent in token of gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> therefore bargained with the Maſter of the Galley, ſo that he had his

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:151308:39"/> but would gladly alſo have had both the money and the purſe. About this time was the day at hand, wherein he had vowed in memorial of Lady <hi>Fortunes</hi> Gift, to beſtow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our hundred pieces of Gold towards the marriage of ſome poor maiden. Wherefore he asked of the Hoſt, whether he knew any poor honeſt man that had a daughter marriageable, and was not able to beſtow her for lack of ability: ſuch a one, ſaid he, bring unto me, and I will beſtow largely on her to prefer her marriage. The Hoſt ſaid, of ſuch you may have plenty; and to morrow I will bring you an honeſt man, who ſhall bring with him a modeſt and comely maiden. This liked <hi>Fortunatus</hi> very well. But then thought the Hoſt with himſelf, this night will I rob him of his money before he beſtow it. So the ſame night did he convey himſelf into their chamber through the ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing, when they were all aſleep, and ſearched their cloaths, ſuppoſing to have found great ſums of money in their Doublets, but therein he was foulely deceived. Howbeit out of <hi>Leopoldus</hi> purſe he took forty Duckats, and handled <hi>Fortunatus</hi> purſe on the out-ſide alſo: but when he felt no money therein, he caſt it under the bed-ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed; which when he had done, he went forth, and ſet open the door and the windows, as though ſome ſtrange thieves had béen there.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Leopoldus</hi> awaked, and ſaw the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and door open, he rebuked the men for their negligence, but the ſervants being faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:151308:40"/> ſtarted up ſuddenly half amazed, ſaying: That they alſo were ignorant thereof. With that <hi>Leopoldus</hi> was greatly afraid, and looked for his Purſe, which he perceived to be cut off, and a piece of the ſtring hanging yet at his girdle. Then called he to <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Our Chamber is burſt open, and the Money which you delivered me is ſtollen. Fortunatus</hi> forthwith looked to his doublet, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fortunate Purſe to be cut away alſo, he was therewith aſtoniſhed, that he ſunk down in a ſwound as though he were dead. <hi>Leopoldus</hi> and the other Servants not knowing of this great loſs, rubbed and refreſhed him, ſo that his ſpirits were revived again.</p>
            <p>As they were thus affrighted and in great perplexity, in came the Hoſt, and ſet a grim countenance on the matter, asking angerly what ailed them to be ſo unquiet? they told him that they were robbed of their money; then ſaid he: <hi>What careleſs men are ye? have ye not a cloſe Chamber with lock and key? why then did ye not make all things faſt and ſure?</hi> They anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>When we went to bed, we both ſhut the windows and locked the door, but now we find them all open.</hi> Then ſaid the Hoſt: <hi>Look that you have not one robbed another, and there be alſo at this preſent many ſtrangers and luſty Fellows in the City, who perhaps had more skill to break into your Chamber then we wot of.</hi> Howbeit when he ſaw them in ſuch ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plight, he asked of <hi>Fortunatus</hi> whither he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:151308:40"/> had loſt any great ſum of money? He ſaid: <hi>Not much.</hi> Then ſaid the Hoſt, <hi>Why then do you ſo take on and diſquiet your ſelf for a little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? yeſterday you would have beſtowed a poor mans daughter in marriage: Spare now the Money and beſtow it on your ſelf.</hi> Then ſaid <hi>Fortunatus: I care more for the Purſe than for the Money, for there is in it a Bill of exchange of great importance which can profit none but my ſelf.</hi> When the Hoſt ſaw that <hi>Fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was ſo ſad and heavy for his Purſe (though he was a deſperate and hard-hearted fellow) yet was he moved with ſome Compaſſion; ſaying: <hi>Let us yet ſearch narrowly about the Chamber: Perchance we may find it, for no thief regardeth an empty Purſe.</hi> With that every man began to ſearch, and one of them creeping under the bed-ſted, found the Purſe, and ſhewed it <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> who preſently knew the ſame: but yet feared greatly leſt that by the cutting it had loſt its Vertue, which he ſore longed to know, but durſt not as yet make tryal in his fight; for he miſdoubted the worſt, that if any had known the quality of the Purſe, they would have murthered him for it. So then lay he down in his Bed again, and privily under the Covering put his Hand in the Purſe, and found that it retained ſtill the vertue it had before: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was exceeding glad. Howbeit he was ſo ſore affrighted with fear, and vexed with anger and ſorrow before, that he could not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151308:41"/> ſo ſoon perfectly recover again his former ſtrength and colour, but remained ſo in his bed all that day. <hi>Leopoldus</hi> came to comfort him, ſaying: Good Sir pluck up your lively ſpirits, and be content, we have left fair Horſes, Chains, and Rings of Gold and other Iewels: ſo although we have no money, we will ſell all theſe things, and by Gods help bring you ſafe home again: for I have full often paſſed many Countries without money; For <hi>Leopol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> thought in his mind that <hi>Fortunatus</hi> had riches ſufficient at home, if he might attain thither. But <hi>Fortunatus</hi> anſwered faintly, and ſaid: he that looſeth goods, looſeth underſtanding; Wiſdom is to be choſen before Riches,: alſo health, ſtrength, beauty, and long life, can no man ſteal; and therewith held his peace. <hi>Leopoldus</hi> wiſt not what he meant by thoſe affectionate words, neither knew he which he had choſen of all theſe gifts: And ſuppoſing that ſuch ſudden paſſions proceeded of the lightneſs and diſturbance of his head, was no farther inquiſitive to know his meaning. Howbeit after a while, <hi>Fortunatus</hi> being with warm meat refreſhed, his Colour was reſtored, and began to be merry again, commanding his Servants to provide Candles to keep light in the Chamber all the Night long, and that they ſhould have their naked Swords ready drawn by them, to prevent the like Attempt of thieves. In the morning went <hi>Fortunatus</hi> with his men into the Church of <hi>Sephia,</hi> and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151308:41"/> there gave to the Prieſts ten pieces of Gold, that they ſhould in our Ladies Chappel which was fair and ſumptuous, cauſe a Sermon to be made, and <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be ſung to the praiſe of God. From thence went he to the place where Marchants and Exchangers reſorted, and willed all his men to go home to tend the Horſes, and prepare their dinner: and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Leopoldus</hi> certain money to buy five Purſes, ſaying: I will go to my Exchanger to take up ſome money, of which we may not in any caſe be long deſtitute. When <hi>Leopoldus</hi> had bought the Purſes, <hi>Fortunatus</hi> put in one of them an hundred Duckats, which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Leopoldus</hi> to be disburſed upon ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expences. He gave alſo to each of his three men a Purſe with ten Duckats therein, and ſaid unto them, be merry and wiſe, take good heed that no ſuch danger befal unto us, as hath of late hapned. They all thanked him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed their diligent and careful ſervice to their uttermoſt power. He moreover put four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred duckats into the fifth purſe, ſending for the Hoſt, to whom he ſaid, do I pray as I requeſt concerning ſome Poor mans Daughter, on whom I purpoſe to beſtow liberally toward her marriage. The Hoſt ſaid, I will bring unto you a Man with his Daughter, that you may ſee them. With that he went to the Poor Man, and told him he had a Rich Gueſt; take (ſaid he) your Daughter with you, and go with me, and thou ſhalt ſee how well the

            <p>THe Maidens Father was a Ioyner, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt &amp; homely fellow, who ſaid to the hoſt I would be loath to bring my Daughter any where abroad, I wot not to whom, leſt ſhe ſhould be abuſed &amp; loſe her virginity, which is the chiefeſt Iewel that ſhe hath to make her fit for a husband: therefore tell the gentleman if he mean to do her any good, that if it pleaſe him he may come hither to ſee her. Hereat was the hoſt diſpleaſed, &amp; declaring his uncourteous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſuppoſed that <hi>Fortunatus</hi> would be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with offended alſo: but he took it in good part, and was well content. And taking <hi>Leopoldus</hi> with him, willed the hoſt to bring him to the mans houſe, to whom he ſaid: <hi>My hoſt here hath given me to underſtand that thou haſt a fair daughter, which is at womans ſtate, let her come unto me with her mother.</hi> He asked, for what intent? <hi>Perhaps,</hi> ſaid <hi>Fortunatus, more for thy commodity than thou woteſt of.</hi> With that the poor man called forth his wife &amp; his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which were aſhamed of their homely appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, eſpecially the baſhful maiden, which hovered behind her mothers back. Howbeit ſhe was both fair &amp; well-favoured: to whom <hi>Fortunatus</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:151308:42"/> ſaid: <hi>Stand forth fair Virgin before me, and be not abaſhed.</hi> Then asked he her Father of her age, who ſaid: She is full twenty years old. Then ſaid he, Why have you kept her ſo long unmarried? to which the Mother made quick ſpeed to anſwer before her husband, ſaying, ſhe was tall and old enough ſix years agon, but ſhe wanted ability to marry her. Then ſaid <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus,</hi> if I would beſtow on her a large dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, could you forthwith find out a fit husband for her? Then ſaid the mother: Our neighbor hath a Son who beareth unto her good Will, who <hi>I</hi> know but only for want of wealth would take her to his Wife. Then asked he the maiden how ſhe liked of her neighbours Son: She anſwered: <hi>I will in no caſe make my own choice, though I ſhould die without a husband: but whom my Father and Mother will appoint unto me, the ſame will I have:</hi> With that the mother could not ſtay from ſpeaking, and ſaid: <hi>I know ſhe ſaith not as ſhe thinketh, and I am certain ſhe loveth him, and would fain have him before any other. Fortunatus</hi> then ſending for the young man, whom at the firſt he liked very well, poured out of a Purſe four hundred Duckats upon the Table before them: and ſaid to the young man, who was but thirty years old, wilt thou be content to Wed this Maid? &amp; to the maid he ſaid, art thou willing to have this man for thy husband, &amp; I am diſpoſed to give you freely this little money for a dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Then anſwered the young man, ſaying: If
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151308:43"/> you mean good earneſt, and indeed will perform your liberal promiſe, for my part we ſhall be ſoon agreed. The mother without further pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing offered her conſent, and ſaid: Then doth my Daughter likewiſe agree thereto. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Fortunatus</hi> forthwith ſent for a Prieſt, and cauſed them to be married in the preſence of their Parents, and after the marriage was finiſhed, he gave unto them the money which he had brought only for that purpoſe. He gave alſo to the Father ten Duckats to cloath him and his wife, and ten Duckats more to keep the marriage feaſt; whereof they were all glad, thanking greatly <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and praiſed God for their good fortune, ſaying among them God hath ſurely ſent this man from heaven to help the poor.</p>
            <p>After this they went again to their Inn, but <hi>Leopoldus</hi> marvelled that his Maſter was ſo liberal to give money ſo lightly, whereas before he was ſo ſad for a little money that he had loſt. The Hoſt likewiſe was grieved that he could not find the Purſe with the four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Duckats, when as he ſearched ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and therefore thought thus with himſelf, ſithence he hath ſo much to give away, I muſt needs empty his purſe once again. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing that they had a Taper of wax to burn all night, when they were all gone forth to the Court, brake privily into the Chamber, made holes in the Taper, poured in Water, and ſtopped them cloſe that it could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151308:43"/> ſo that when it had burnt two or three hours, it ſhould quench and go out of it ſelf. So foraſmuch as the Emperours Feaſt was nigh ended, when as he knew <hi>Fortunatus</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, he determined the ſame night to rob his gueſt again. Wherefore he provided for them againſt they came from the Court, the beſt Wine that he could get, and gave it them of his own coſt to drink, to the intent they ſhould ſleep the ſounder. So when they had made good chear, and were laid down to reſt, the taper burning, and their naked ſwords lay by them, they fell into a ſound ſleep without eare.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151308:45"/> ſo that no body ſaw or heard him. Then returned he to the Chamber and ſaid: I have rid us of this Thief, ſo that in a great while none can know where he is become.

            <p>ANd as ſoon as he might bring it to paſs, he purchaſed again his Fathers houſe; and many more thereto adjoyning: All which he cauſed to be plucked down, and in that place builded a goodly large Palace after the braveſt manner, like as he had ſeen in other Countries. And by the houſe alſo he founded a ſumptuous Church, and twelve more houſes for twelve Prieſts to continue in divine ſervice of God, as it were a Chantry or Cathedral Minſter. For the Revenues whereof, he alſo allowed yearly <hi>xiv</hi> hundred Duckats: that was for every Prieſt one hundred, and the other two for the Reparation and Ornaments of the Church. He cauſed moreover to be made in the Minſter three Tombs, one for his Father, the other for his Mother, whoſe bones he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be digged up, and buried therein: and the third to be reſerved for himſelf and his Heirs. When all things were finiſhed to his mind, he purpoſed to take a Wife, which when the nobility and gentlemen of <hi>Cyprus</hi> underſtood,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:151308:47"/> every one which had the faireſt daughters, ſet them forth to the uttermoſt ſhew, by training them up with fine qualities, nurturing them with good behaviour, and trimming them in comely and gorgeous attire. But amongſt all others, not far from <hi>Famagoſta</hi> dwell an Earl named Lord <hi>Nemian,</hi> which had three daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that were paſſing fair, whom the King counſelled to beſtow one of them on <hi>Fortunatus</hi> if he might, and offered himſelf alſo to break the matter if the Earl were ſo content. Now the Earl, though he were not very rich, ſéemed at the firſt to make little account of <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> ſaying to the King: If he ſhould be a ſuitor to any of my daughters, would your Grace ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe me to give my conſent? For we know he hath no lands nor yearly revenues: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as perhaps he had great ſums of ready money, we ſee how he hath beſtowed it in ſumptuous building, whereof cometh no profit. And albeit he have ſufficient ſtore yet left, money is caſual and may ſoon be conſumed and loſt, and ſo may he come to be in poverty at the end as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, who ſometime was exceeding Rich and Puiſſant. Then ſaid the King to the Earl, I have been certified by them that have ſeen it, that he hath as many precious Iewels as would buy an Earldom, and yet will ſell none of them. I hear ſay alſo, that he hath travelled through many nations, whereby it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed that he would not have builded ſuch a gorgeous Palace, and a Chantry which he
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151308:48"/> hath ſo endowed with perpetual Rents, except he well knew how to maintain an eſtate agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: And therefore if you will do by my counſel, you ſhall (now he is diſpoſed to marry) offer unto him one of your Daughters. And if ſo be you are willing ſo to do, I my ſelf will do my diligence in firſt motioning of the matter, not doubting to bring it to paſs. For <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> I know will do much at my requeſt: and indeed I had rather he ſhould match in a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kindred, than with one of the meaner ſort, being alſo unmeet (as to me ſeemeth) that one of a baſe Linage ſhould poſſeſs that fair Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and dwell therein.</p>
            <p>The Earl underſtanding that <hi>Fortunatus</hi> was greatly in the Kings favor, ſaid: foraſmuch as I perceive your graces pleaſure is that I ſhould give one of my daughters to <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> therein I give your majeſty full power, both of her and my goods, Then ſaid the King, Lord <hi>Nemian</hi> ſend your three daughters to my Wife the Queen, and I will cauſe them to be gorgeouſly attired, upon hope that one of them ſhall pleaſe him: howbeit I will give him the choice, to take which he beſt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth; I will moreover beſtow all the charges of the Wedding Feaſt, and look what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth more, that will I perform, for that thou haſt frankly committed both Body and Goods unto me. The Earl humbly thanked his Majeſty, and ſo taking his leave of the King, rode home and declared to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151308:48"/> his wife all the matter as it was decreed between the King and him.</p>

Howbeit ſhe agreed to his will: whereupon ſhe comely addreſſed them, and appointed a motherly Gentlewoman to be their Guide, with men and maidens to attend on them, as was meet for their eſtate; they were ſent unto the Kings Court, where they with their retinue were honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and were taught the courteous guiſe and nurture of the Court, whereof they were not altogether ignorant before. When the King thought it moſt convenient, he ſent a Meſſenger for <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> that he ſhould come to the Court. And albeit he was not certified for what cauſe he was ſent for, yet he preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that it was for no ill intent, ſpeedily prepared himſelf and rode to the King, of whom he was friendly entertained.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the King unto him: <hi>Fortunatus</hi> thou art my Subject, and I am well perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thee, that thou will have reſpect unto my counſel, for that I would be loath to with thee any evil.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:151308:49"/> thou ſhouldeſt take one whom I ſhould not well like of, I have bethought me of a wife for thée, by whom the worthineſs of thy Linage ſhall be advanced. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> anſwered, ſaying: Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord, truth it is, that I am diſpoſed to marry, and meant to have eſpyed out a wife for my liking, but foraſmuch as I now perceive that your Grace will vouchſafe ſo far to debate your Royal eſtate, as to provide ſo favourably for me, I will no farther ſeek nor be careful, but will gladly put my whole truſt and confidence in your Majeſties aſſignment. When he had this anſwer of <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and was alſo aſſured of the Earls aſſent who had committed to him his daughters, he thought in his mind, a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is here eaſie to be made, and ſaid to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus</hi> as enſueth.</p>
            <p>I have in my cuſtody three fair Ladies, which be all Siſters by one Father, and one Mother: The eldeſt is eighteen years of age named <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana;</hi> the ſecond is ſeventeen years old, called <hi>Marcepia;</hi> the third of the ſecond lacketh four years, whoſe name is <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> I will permit thee of theſe three to have thy choice: therefore adviſe thee whether thou wilt ſee them one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, or view them altogether. <hi>Fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> made no long deliberation, but ſaid: My So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord, ſix hence your grace granteth me ſuch free choice, I require of your Majeſty that I may ſee them all three ſtanding together, and hear each of them ſpeak.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:151308:49"/>
            <p>The King granted his requeſt, and ſent word preſently to the Queen, that ſhe ſhould cauſe her Ladies to be trimmed in the beſt attire, for that he would come thither, and bring a Gueſt with him. When the King thought all things were ready, he would have taken <hi>Fortunatus</hi> alone with him, who entreated the King, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: if it pleaſe your Grace, ſuffer alſo this old ſervant of mine to go with me: the King grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo took they <hi>Leopoldus</hi> with them, and came into the chamber where the Ladies were.</p>

She anſwered: My So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord, it is not meet for me to anſwer that queſtion: and although I might chooſe, yet would I not follow my own Fantaſie: but that your Grace and my Lord and Father do Command, the ſame ought I to Obey. Then ſpake he to the ſecond, ſaying: <hi>Marcepia,</hi> tell me truly which thou loveſt beſt, the Earl thy Father, or the Counteſs thy Mother. She
<pb facs="tcp:151308:50"/> likewiſe anſwered, Let your grace pardon me for it is not convenient to give my reſolution to this demand. I love them both well, and with all my heart; if I loved the one better than the other, I ſhould be ſorry my Heart ſhould know it, and aſhamed that my Mouth ſhould confeſs it: for I have found in them both as much natural love and friendſhip, as a Daughter might look for of her parents.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151308:50"/> With that the King ceaſed asking, and troubled them no more. Then went the King aſide into another Chamber with <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and ſaid unto him: Thy deſire was to ſee theſe three Ladies, and to hear them ſpeak, which I have ſhewed thee to the uttermoſt: now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determine with thy ſelf which of them thou thinkeſt meet to be thy Spouſe. <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> anſwered: I like them all ſo well (my Liege) that I cannot ſo ſuddenly adviſe me which I may chooſe. Wherefore I beſeech your Majeſty, to grant me but a little ſpace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and conſult with my old and truſty ſervant <hi>Leopoldus</hi> therein. The King therewith was well content, and ſo let him depart aſide to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate of the matter.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Fortunatus</hi> withdrawing himſelf into a ſecret place, ſaid to <hi>Leopoldus:</hi> Thou haſt ſeen and heard theſe three Ladies as will as I, and foraſmuch as I conſider that in matters conſiſting of meer Fantaſie, reaſon and right judgement be often abandoned by wilful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, therefore do I firſt require thy opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo in this caſe, before I proceed to farther choice, deſiring thee to councel me, even as the Caſe were thine own. <hi>Leopoldus</hi> being ſomewhat abaſhed with this Demand, ſaid, Sir, It is not for you to regard my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Point: For many times one Brother liketh of that which is Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant unto the other; and moſt often it chanceth that every Singular man hath a
<pb facs="tcp:151308:51"/> particular judgment, and that eſpecially in the choice of a woman. Therefore your own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this caſe ſhould be more acceptable, than any forreign councel: for that good liking is the root of ſound love. Then ſaid <hi>Fortunatus:</hi> Of all this full well I wot, and that I take a Wife for my ſelf and for no other: But yet would I fain that thou ſhouldeſt diſcloſe the ſecrets of thy heart unto me, for thy experience is far greater than mine, to judge the inward diſpoſition by the outward marks and tokens of Phyſiognomy, which often proveth true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leopoldus</hi> was very loath to move him any way, fearing leſt if he did not counſel him as his Fancy was before bent, he would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be diſcontented. Howbeit thus much he ſaid: Sir, They all three like me very well; and as far as I can gueſs, they be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſiſters, or ſiſters Children: neither do I mark any tokens of unfaithfulneſs in them. Then asked <hi>Fortunatus</hi> of which of them he thought beſt? <hi>Leopoldus</hi> anſwered: I will not firſt counſel, neither ſhall you firſt chooſe, leſt if I ſhould miſlike that you beſt fancied, you might be offended. Therefore take we each of us a piece of Paper, and therein let us write both our minds aſunder, you at one end of the Table, and I at the other. This device liked <hi>Fortunatus</hi> well, and ſo did both accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>

            <p>Then ſaid <hi>Leopoldus:</hi> This is much more
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:151308:55"/> than I have deſerved either of God or Man, that ſuch honour and courteſie ſhould be proffered to me in my old Age: wherefore I yield to you as hearty thanks as one man may tender to another.</p>
            <p>But as concerning this choice; to ride home again, for one of my years, it is very painful and unmeet; and perhaps I may dye by the way; yea, though I might come ſafely home, <hi>Ireland</hi> being a hard and uncivil country, where are no good wives, nor delicate victuals well prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereto I have been long accuſtomed, my life (moſt like) would be the ſooner ſhortned. And to remain ſtill in houſhold with you, for me is more unfit: For whereas you have now a Fair young luſty Wife, many goodly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen and jolly Fellows about you. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old and feeble, ſhall be loathſome unto them; for the behaviour of old men, is irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto the younger ſort.

The Admiral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed his requeſt in all reſpects, whereof he was glad, and incontinently furniſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all that ſhould accompany him with all things neceſſary &amp; expedient at his own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; &amp; ſo made his firſt journey through the land of <hi>Perſia;</hi> from thence he paſſed through the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Cathay,</hi> and ſo through the deſart, came to the Court of <hi>Preſter John,</hi> who had under him, both of the Iſles and firm Land <hi>lxxii</hi> Kings, every one of the which Countries is full of People, fair Cities, and ſtrong holds: There <hi>Fortunatus</hi> gave unto <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter John</hi> many goodly Iewels and preſents, ſuch as were rare and ſtrange in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. He gave alſo many gifts unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the privy Chamber, and ſuch as were in authority; requeſting them to aſſiſt and further him, that he might take up certain Men, and have the Kings Letters to addreſs him to <hi>Calicuate,</hi> whereas the beſt Pepper groweth like unto Grapes, and the men of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151308:60"/> country for extream heat go all naked. <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> therefore not able for parching heat to travel any farther that way, and now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his beloved wife and his two ſons, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be at <hi>Famagoſta,</hi> and ſo returted a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way homeward, through many other ſtrange Countries, until he came to the City <hi>Lamecha;</hi> and there bought a Chamel, whereon he rode through the deſart of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monuments of our Saviours Paſſions. The time whereas he appointed to be again at <hi>Alexandria</hi> was nigh at hand, within two months: wherefore he took ſhipping to abridge his Iourney, and made haſt away, until he was arrived again at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> where he went preſently unto the Souldan, thanking him and the Lord Admiral highly for their Letters; by whom he was entertained very honourably, when they underſtood that he had ſo manly behaved himſelf, and had ſeen ſo many ſtrange Countries.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Fortunatus</hi> had been now eight days at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> having there with him many ſtrange beaſts and other rare Novelties, he longed greatly for the Ship, that he might ſet forward to <hi>Famagoſta.</hi> In the mean time was the ſhip arrived, laden with ſo much, and ſo rich Merchandiſe, that ſhe was thrice better in value than when ſhe departed, whereof <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> was exceeding glad, eſpecially for the health of his men, and that they had brought Letters from <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> ſignifying that ſhe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:151308:60"/> and her Children were in good eſtate, wanting only his preſence. Wherefore he willed his Merchants to make a ſpeedy ſale, and to afford theſe wares better cheap than they commonly uſed. And in ſo doing, as they were willed, whereas other ſhips do ſcant make their Mart in ſix weeks, they diſpatched all their buſineſs in twenty days, when as <hi>Fortunatus</hi> would have preſently taken his leave and departed: But the Souldan requeſted him to ſtay with him at Supper the night before he departed, which he could not refuſe, but willed his men to go aboard, and to lanch out the Ship from the Haven into the Rode, appointing preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after ſupper to come unto them, and ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. In the mean while went <hi>Fortunatus</hi> with the Admiral unto the Kings Palace, where he was worthily entertained. Then communed the Souldan with him concerning his Affairs and ſucceſs in ſtrange Nations, which he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at large, thanking him again for his Letters of addreſs, ſaying: That by them he was greatly furthered, and the more accepted of ſtrange Princes. By this time was the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ready; the King was ſet at the Table, and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> was placed almoſt over againſt him, where they were ſerved with all kind of delicate fare, as was convenient for ſuch a Mighty Prince.</p>

            <p>VVHen ſupper was ended, <hi>Fortunatus</hi> craved licence to beſtow his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the houſhold, which the Souldan gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he opened his purſe privily under the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and when he had given to every man in the houſe a large gift, according to their degrée, the Souldan marvelled with himſelf how he could bear ſo much Gold about him unperceived, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeming it a great honour done to him, that he had béen ſo liberal to his ſervants, ſaying: right
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:151308:61"/> courteous Gentleman, this your bountiful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and liberal disburſing towards me and all mine, deſerveth no ſmall commendation and recompence: come therefore with me, and I will ſhew you that before you go, which few or none doth know but my ſelf, and the like whereof you never ſaw: With that he brought him unto a ſtrong Tower, vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted all with Marble-ſtone; in the firſt room whereof were a great number of veſſels, and Iewels of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and huge heaps of ſilver coyns: In the ſecond were many veſſels and houſhold imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gold; and many great Cheſts full of golden Coyn: within that was a great Ward-rope, full of many coſtly Iewels and gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous garments, beautified with precious ſtones of all ſorts, belonging to the ornaments for his Body: There were alſo two golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, upon which ſtood two orient and great Carbuncles, which ſhone in the night all over the Chamber. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> was rapt with great admiration to behold this infinite Treaſure, praiſing it greatly: Then ſaid the Souldan, I have yet a jewel in my Chamber which I more eſteem than all thoſe you have ſeen: Then the King carried him to his own Bed-chamber, which was ſumptuouſly adorned, having a proſpect unto the main Sea, and there opening a cloſet, brought forth in his hand a plain Felt hat, baſe and ſimple to behold, ſaying: I ſet more by this Hat, than by all the Precious Iewels that I poſſeſs, for that if I had no Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:151308:62"/> money would get them, but ſuch an Hat is not to be had.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> if it ſo pleaſe your Majeſty, I would gladly know what power and vertue conſiſteth in this hat. The King ſaid, it hath this quality, that whoſoever hath it on his head, where he wiſheth then to be, he is with a thought conveyed thither; ſo that with the fame have I more pleaſure than with all my je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels: for when my men go forth to hunt, and I long to be with them, ſetting my Hat on my head, where the beſt game is to be ſeen, I am there ſuddenly preſent: and where the Deer reſteth, I can be there when I liſt, to drive them to the hunters hand. In time of wars alſo, I can be with my Souldiers when I lift, and in my Palace again w th a wiſh, which all my Iewels cannot do. Then demanded <hi>Fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> if he that made that Hat were yet alive: The King ſaid, of that I am uncertain. Then thought <hi>Fortunatus</hi> in his mind: How well would this Hat agree with the Purſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and ſaid unto the King: Methinks, ſithence that Hat hath ſuch great vertue, that it would ſeem very heavy on his head that weareth it. Then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King, that it was no heavier than another Hat, and therewith bid him to eſſay it on his head, asking him whether he fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> anſwered, ſaying: Verily I did not think it had been ſo light, neither ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed I that your Grace wou d be ſo unadviſed to ſet it on my head: with that he ſuddenly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:151308:62"/> wiſhed himſelf into his ſhip, willing ſpeedily to hoiſe the ſail, and having a freſh gale of wind, they ſailed ſwiftly away: when the Souldan ſaw he was thus deceived of ſuch an incomparable Iewel, perceived alſo at the window that the ſhip was under ſail, he in great rage comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his men to ſet after <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and to bring him back priſoner, threatning to him a cruel death. But ere they could be ſcantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the ſhip was clean paſſed out of ſight; ſo that the Meſſengers returned again in vain, whereof the King was exceeding ſorry.</p>
            <p>Now when the Factors of <hi>Venice, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Genua</hi> underſtood that <hi>Fortunatus</hi> was gone with the Kings Iewel, they inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, ſaying among themſelves: The King and the Admiral are but very wel ſerved; for whereas they thought they could not do unto him too much honour, he hath therefore yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a fair recompence: but yet are we now ſure that he will not return hither again to hinder our Marts as he hath done. Now the Souldan being thus in a great agony for his Hat, would gladly have deviſed how to obtain it again, but wiſt not how to attempt the matter.</p>
            <p>To ſend his Admiral, or any of his heathen Lords among the Chriſtians, he thought it both dangerous and little available: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought beſt to ſend the Captain of the Chrſtians in his Embaſſage unto <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:151308:63"/> to deal by way of entreaty. Wherefore he called the Captain unto him, who was a <hi>Venetian,</hi> named <hi>Marcholandus,</hi> requeſting him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh an Embaſſage faithfully unto <hi>Fortunatus</hi> in <hi>Cyprus:</hi> and ſhewing him the caſe before, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to ſay unto <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> that if he would vouchſafe of courteſie to ſend him the hat again, ſithence he ſhewed it him upon truſt, he would accept it thankfully, and would ſend his Ship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain laden with coſtly ſpices: but if he would not be ſo entreated, that he ſhould make his complaint unto the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> requeſting him to enforce <hi>Fortunatus</hi> to ſend the Iewel which he had unfaithfully carried from him: the Captain promiſed truly and diligently to do his meſſage. Whereupon the Souldan cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ordained for him a fair and ſtrong ſhip, well manned with Chriſtian Marriners, in all points ſufficiently appointed, promiſing unto him rich rewards if he could bring the Hat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

            <p>Vpon theſe words <hi>Marcholandus</hi> truſted no more to entreaty, but wrathfully departed unto the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to whom he made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, requeſting his Majeſty that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force <hi>Fortunatus</hi> his ſubject to reſtore again to the Souldan the Iewel which he had moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully gotten, and now wrongfully detained: ſaying, that if it were not by fear means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, great Wars were like thereof to enſue.

There he accompanied himſelf with Earls, Lords, and Knights; for he maintained his Eſtate as ſumptuouſly as the beſt of them: Wherefore he was had in great eſtimation with every man; attending alſo daily on the King, as if he had been an ordinary Servant. In the mean time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel, that a Challenge was made by certain Lords and Gentlemen, to Iuſt, Wraſtle,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:151308:67"/> and leap with any one that would contend with him: <hi>Andolocia</hi> advanced himſelf to try his force in all theſe Games, wherein he excelled them all.

            <p>After the Revels was ordained a Banquet, whereto the King alſo invited <hi>Andolocia,</hi> and as he ſat at the Table, it chanced that he was fuddenly pricked with a paſſion of hot love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a fair Gentlewoman, whoſe Husband was moſt familiar with him of all the other in the Court: Wherefore as ſoon as he was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the Table, without delay or long circumſtance, he rounding her in the ear, offered her a thouſand Crowns, on condition ſhe would grant to lye with him but one night. The Gentlewoman being a Faithful and Chaſt Wife, would not Conſent thereto, but preſently detected the great offer of <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locia</hi> unto her husband; who ſaid unto her: A thouſand Crowns would do us great pleaſure, and were ſoon earned: howbeit honeſty paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Riches, and the infamy that thereby to us both might enſue, can with no Money be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

            <p>THe Gentlewoman gave him very friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertainment, and receiving the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of him untold, brought him into her Chamber, willing him to go ſo bed, and ſhe would immediately come unto him.

            <p>
               <hi>Andolocia</hi> hearing that he was ſo deceived, waxed angry in his mind, not ſo much for the loſs of the money, but rather for ſhame that it ſhould be blazed abroad to his reproach, how he was deluded by two Women. Wherefore he forthwith roſe up, and gave his Leman an hundred Crowns, willing her that after his departure, ſhe ſhould challenge nine hundred more, which the Gentlewoman wrongfully detained, and that ſhe her ſelf hath duly earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which the Wench performed with ſuch impudent and open contention, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman for all her pretended honeſty being noted for a Baud, ſuſtained great ſhame.

When he was now gone ten or twelve miles from <hi>Paris,</hi> he thought in his mind, it was well the falſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151308:69"/> Harlots had not beguiled me of my Purſe, and began to be merry and pleaſant, and ſo rode unto the King of <hi>Arragons</hi> Court: from thence to the King of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> then to the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal:</hi> and next to the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Court: There did the people and their behaviour like him ſo well, that he apparelled himſelf and all his men after their Country Guiſe; and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſervice unto the King, was thankfully entertained. He daily practiſed all feats of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, and oftentimes gave Iewels, for which Gentlemen ſhould contend in martial games, and invited the Ladies and Gentlewomen to many coſtly Banquets. Moreover when there was any preſſing of Souliers, he would ſet forth an hundred at his own charges, and load them, whereby he was had in great favour and eſtimation with the King. And foraſmuch as he was ſo active, valiant, and couragious, that he would commonly be in the forefront of the battel, the King dub'd him Knight, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended otherwiſe to advance him. Inſomuch that whereas there was in the Court, and Old Earl which had one only Daughter, which was his Heir, to her would the King have Married <hi>Andolocia,</hi> promiſing him alſo the Earldom after her Fathers deceaſe. But <hi>Andolocia</hi> lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Earls daughter, neither regarded he the Earldom; for he was rich enough by the vertue of his Purſe: When <hi>Andolocia</hi> had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King of <hi>Spain</hi> certain years, he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leave to depart. The King granted to his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:151308:70"/> requeſt, and told him, that whenſoever his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was to repair to <hi>Spain</hi> again, he ſhould find him always a friendly and gracious Lord, for his faithful ſervice. Then bought <hi>Andolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> a ſhip, wherein he and his men ſailed into <hi>England,</hi> whereof ſome that envied at his coſtly and ſumptuous behaviour were glad, and many other were ſorry, which had received commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity by him.</p>
            <p>When he was now come to the fair City of <hi>London,</hi> where the King then kept his Court, he hired a goodly houſe, and bought all neceſſary furniture plentifully for it: There he kept an open Court, with liberal hoſpitality, like as if he had been a Prince, daily feaſting the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Courtiers, to whom he alſo gave many gifts, and uſed to juſt, and practiſed other martial exerciſes with them: but in all feats of chivalry, both men and women gave <hi>Andolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> the praiſe.</p>

            <p>THen ordained the King a great Dinner, and invited thereto <hi>Andolocia,</hi> and all the other Captains, where was alſo preſent the Queen and her fair Daughter <hi>Agrippina,</hi> who ſurpaſſed in beauty all the women in <hi>England:</hi> whom when <hi>Andolocia</hi> had ſtedfaſtly beheld, his Heart was ſo fervently kindled with the love of her, that he had no more liſt to eat or drink, were the meats never ſo delicious or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate. When the feaſt was done, and he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to his houſe, he thought by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how he might win the favour of <hi>Agrippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> wiſhing that he were of Royal blood, that he might be eſteemed Worthy to Marry her: Howbeit he encouraged himſelf with Hope, to purchaſe her good Will and Liking by ſome means or other. Wherefore he advanced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from thenceforth in Juſting and other Martial exerciſes before the Queen and her Daughter very often, and in more Gorgeous manner than he was wont, wherewith Fair Ladies be moſt delighted. And when he
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:151308:71"/> thought it convenient, he invited the Queen and her daughter, with many other Ladies of the Court to dinner, which was ſo ſumptuouſly in all points adorned, that it was wonderful in a ſubjects houſe to behold.</p>
            <p>He gave alſo to the Queen a coſtly Iewel, and another to <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and to every one of her Waiting Gentlewomen one, that he might be the better Eſteemed of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> when he came to the Court: whereof the King was informed: Inſomuch that when <hi>Andolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> came unto the Court, the King ſaid unto him: I underſtand by the Queen that ſhe hath been very well and ſumptuouſly entertained at your Houſe: Why had not I alſo warning thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andolocia</hi> ſaid: Moſt gracious Lord, if your Majeſty would not diſdain to honour my poor Houſe with your preſence, how acceptable ſhould it be unto me! Then ſaid the King: I will alſo come to morrow unto you, and bring ten more of my Counſel with me.</p>
            <p>Of this was <hi>Andolocia</hi> very glad, and haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him home to prepare all things accordingly. The next day came the King and the Lords to dinner; where all things were ſo magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently accompliſhed upon ſo ſhort warning, that the King and ſuch as came with him greatly marvelled thereat. Then thought the King, it were good to abate the pride of <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locia,</hi> and to make him aſhamed; wherefore he appointed the next day alſo to take his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:151308:71"/> with <hi>Andolocia</hi> again, and forthwith ſent privy commandment, that no Wood-ſeller ſhould upon pain of his grievous diſpleaſure, ſell or give one ſtick of Wood, or any kind of fuel unto <hi>Andolocia,</hi> or any of his retinue, during the ſpace of two days. Howbeit <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolocia</hi> was glad of it, and had prepared all the Delicateſt Victuals that was to be had for money: but when he could by no means get any Wood or other fuel, he was ſore afraid left he ſhould be utterly ſhamed, not knowing how the Cooks ſhould dreſs the meat; but when he ſaw no other remedy, he ſent ſpeedily to the Merchants Ships, and to all the Grocers in <hi>London</hi> to buy an huge quantity of Canes, Cloves, Nutmegs, Liquoriſh, Ginger, and Cinamon, which were uſed in the Chimneys and Ovens, to burn inſtead of Wood, to dreſs the Meat. About dinner time, though the King ſuppoſed that <hi>Andolocia's</hi> Kitchin was but ſimply provided for lack of Fire, yet would he and other Lords that were with him before, ride unto <hi>Andolocia's</hi> Lodging, where they ſmelt ſuch an exceeding ſtrong and ſweet ſavour, that they muſed whereof it ſhould be.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:151308:75"/> requeſted to have the Purſe to his own Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, leſt <hi>Agrippina</hi> ſhould come in danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. But ſhe alledging the danger that ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured in the getting of it, if he had awaked on a ſudden, requeſted earneſtly of her Father that ſhe might have the keeping of it only for her labour; affirming that the King and Queen both notwithſtanding, might have as great commodity by it as ſhe her ſelf: wherewith they were content.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Andolocia</hi> was awaked, and ſaw none by him but the old chamber-maid, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had ſlept all night in the chair, he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed greatly, and asked what was become of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina?</hi> the old gentlewoman ſaid: the Quéen ſent for her, and ſhe is riſen: but ſir, I marvel much how you could ſleep ſo out of meaſure: for I often aſſayed to awake you with great noiſe and ſtirring of your body, but all your ſences were ſo benumbed, that if I had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived breath to iſſue from your mouth, <hi>I</hi> ſhould have ſuppoſed you had been dead, whereby you have loſt your paſtime with <hi>Agrippina.</hi> When <hi>Andolocia</hi> underſtood that by drowſte ſleeping he was ſo fruſtrated of his purpoſe, he began to curſe himſelf, and ſwear like a Tyrant. The Old Gentlewoman aſſayed to pacifie his wrath with fair words, ſaying: Sir, I pray you let reaſon rule your furious paſſion, and be contented, for that you have now let paſs, may hereafter be obtained at a like opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Andolocia</hi> ſaid again, ragingly, a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:151308:75"/> light on thee thou old Bawd, why didſt thou ſuffer me to ſleep ſo long? for I never yet ſlept ſo long in all my life, but that if I were lightly touched, I did preſently awake: But ſhe ſtill affirmed, and thereto ſwore, that ſhe did her utmoſt endeavour, and anſwered him with fair language (for in the evening before, he had given her a hundred Crowns) ſo that with fair words in the end ſhe brought him out of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina's</hi> Chamber. <hi>Andolocia</hi> then went home to his houſe very ſad and diſpleaſant, for that he had ſo ſhamefully loſt the amorous paſtime that he hoped to enjoy with the fair Princes, but he wiſt not as yet that he had loſt his peerleſs and fortunate Purſe.</p>
            <p>The King being diſpoſed to try how he would behave himſelf after the loſs of his purſe, and whether he had any more of them, ſent word to <hi>Andolocia,</hi> that he would din<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with him the next day. <hi>Andolocia,</hi> being certified thereof, called the Steward, and willed him to prepare a coſtly Dinner; for that the King would be there on the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The Steward anſwered, that he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed much money of ſate, and had not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtore to ſerve the turn. Then took <hi>Andolocia</hi> the Purſe out of his boſome, and would have Delivered him five Hundred Crowns: but when he groped in his Purſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his accuſtained manner, and brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forth, he turned the inſide outward, and felt it throughly, but there was no money to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:151308:76"/> be found. Then was he in a great perplexity, and almoſt diſmayed with bitter anguiſh and ſorrow: calling to mind, how for the contempt of his Fathers advice (that willed him to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecrets of the Purſe to no creature) he was in this manner plagued; but this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance was now too late, and all his ſumptuouſneſs and pride was now quelled, and at an end.</p>
            <p>Wherefore he called all his men before him, and ſaid unto them: I have been your Maſter theſe ten years, wherein I have ſo entertained you, that you wanted nothing which was fit for men to have, neither am I debter to any of you, for you be paid all before hand. The time is now come that I can no longer kéep Houſe, and maintain ſuch a ſtately port as I have done: therefore I muſt deſire you all to provide for your ſelves; as well as you may: for I may remain here no longer, neither have I any more money left than one hundred and fifty Crowns, whereof I will ſpare to each of you ten ſhillings, and will alſo fréely give to every man his horſe whereon he is accuſtomed to ride, and his harneſs thereto belonging.</p>
            <p>Theſe words made all the men aſtoniſhed and affraid, looking one on the other, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled what ſudden miſchance was happened unto their Maſter. Whereupon one that was of all the reſt moſt loving, faithful, and truſty unto <hi>Andolocia,</hi> ſaid, Sir, if any man have done ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then ſaid they: We would be loath in your miſery to leave you, but we will rather ſell horſe, and harneſs, and all that we have, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with you for your comfort &amp; ſolace. <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locia</hi> ſaid: I thank you for your faithful good will, my well-beloved ſervants: if ever fortune ſmile on me again, I will requite your courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte: but now as I have ſaid, and ſaddle my horſe, forthwith, for I will have no man to go or ride with me. The ſervants for ſorrow could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from tears, to ſée the ſuddain calamity of their Maſter, with whom they had lived ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, and ſo brought him to his horſe. <hi>Andolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> then taking his leave of them all, departed with an heavy heart, and travelled the next way both by ſea and land, until he came to his brother <hi>Ampedo.</hi>

Then ſaid <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:151308:78"/> Wherefore I beſeech thée good brother grant to lend me your wiſhing hat, and I truſt therewith to get the Purſe again. <hi>Ampedo</hi> ſaid, it is a common proverb; <hi>Whoſo looſeth his goods, looſeth his wits:</hi> which appeareth by thée, who when thou haſt already deprived us of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur greateſt treaſure, wouldeſt alſo bereave us of the chiefeſt pleaſure: but I trow one of us will be wiſer than to ſuffer thee to carry away the Hat alſo. For me ſéemeth you might be contented to make you paſtime with it when you liſt. When <hi>Andolocia</hi> perceived that his brother would not in any caſe grant that he ſhould carry the Hat from him, he thought by policy to deceive him of it, and ſaid: Dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if I have requeſted that you think incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, I will be contented from henceforth to be ruled by you.</p>
            <p>Soon after as his brothers men were gone forth to hunt, he requeſted the Hat to convey himſelf among them. His Brother not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting any deceit, delivered it unto him. But he having gotten it, came neither at the Wood nor the Men, but wiſhed himſelf at <hi>Genua.</hi> When <hi>Ampedo</hi> ſaw that his Brother had thus deceived him, he took it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding patiently, and hoped that perhaps he would thereby return again with the Purſe alſo. <hi>Andolocia</hi> being now at <hi>Genua,</hi> willed that the faireſt Iewels that were to be had ſhould be brought to his lodging; which when they were ſhewed him, and had agreed on the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151308:78"/> price, he put them in a Casket, &amp; poiſed them with his hand, as though he would eſſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might eaſily carry them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wiſhed himſelf away without payment. The like did he at <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and at laſt with all the Iewels conveyed himſelf to <hi>London</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that the Iewellers whom he had deceived, thought verily ſome Spirit Incarnate had be guiled them. Then went he unto the Court, apparelled like unto a Merchant, and got licence to diſplay his Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els upon a Table, as <hi>Agrippina</hi> with her train of Ladies ſhould came from the Chappel, whom he well knew, but they knew not him, for that he had disfigured his heard, and the colour of his face.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Agrippina</hi> was paſſed by, he gave two Kings unto the two chief Gentlewomen that attended in the Chamber, and requeſted them that they would ſo procure that he might come to their Ladies preſence, ſaying: that he would ſhew her ſuch Iewels, as her Grace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw the like. They promiſed ſo to do, and preſently ſhewed the rings to <hi>Agrippina,</hi> which they ſaid the Merchant had given them, to the intent they ſhould procure that he might come before her, and ſell unto her Grace ſome of the beſt Iewels, for he had many which were very fair and coſtly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippina</hi> ſaid, I believe well that he hath excéeding rich Iewels, for that he would not ſtick fréely to give ſuch fair Kings, therefore
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:151308:79"/> will him to come unto me, for I long to ſee his Wares.</p>
            <p>When he had laid forth the Iewels before <hi>Agrippina,</hi> ſhe liked very well of them, and cheapened thoſe that ſhe beſt fancied, whereof ſome were worth a thouſand Crowns, for which ſhe offered not half the Money. The Merchant ſaid: Gracious Lady, I have been informed that you are the richeſt Princeſs in the World, which moved me to ſeek out the moſt coſtly and faireſt Iewels that are to be be found, to bring unto your noble Grace, for the which I have ſuſtained painful travel, and great danger: Therefore I truſt your Grace would not I ſhould be ſo much looſer by them, as to ſell them for leſs money than they coſt me: But if it pleaſe your grace to chooſe and lay out thoſe that you beſt like, they ſhall be yours for as eaſie a price as I can afford them. Then did <hi>Agrippina</hi> chuſe out ten Iewels, whereof the price amounted to five thouſand Crowns; but ſhe would in no wiſe give ſo much. <hi>Andolocia</hi> hoping ſhe would bring the Purſe, was contented to agree for four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns. So that <hi>Agrippina</hi> took the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and went unto her Chamber, where ſhe took the Purſe out of a Coffer, and knitting it carefully to her girdle, came forth to pay the Merchant. As ſhe came near unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to tell the money, he claſping her ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, held her faſt, and wiſhed that he were in ſome Wilderneſs with her, wherein was no
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:151308:79"/> dwelling nor reſort. With that they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the Air in a ſmall ſpace unto a deſart place in an Iſle that bordereth upon <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and were ſet there under a tree, whereon were growing fair Apples. As <hi>Agrippina</hi> was thus ſuddenly under the tree, having the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in her Lap, and the Purſe at her Girdle, ſhe ſaid to the Merchant: Lord, for thy mercy where are we now, or how came we hither? I am exceeding faint and hot; therefore I pray reach me ſome of thoſe Apples to refreſh me. The Iewels that he had left poured he into her lap alſo, and ſet the hat on her head to ſhadow her from the parching heat of the Sun, leſt it ſhould trouble him in climbing. As he was thus on the top of the tree, looking for the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Apples, ſhe ſitting under full heavily, began to ſay, would God I were in my Chamber a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. With that ſhe was preſently in her Chamber. The King, the Queen, and the Courtiers asked where ſhe had been, and where the Marchant was become that carried her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? She ſaid: God bleſs me from ſuch Merchants; I ſuppoſe it was the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or ſome of his Angels; Howbeit I left him on the top of a tree: but I pray you trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me with no more queſtions, for I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding faint and weary, and muſt needs reſt me a while.</p>

            <p>VVHen <hi>Andolocia</hi> ſitting on the tree, ſaw that <hi>Agrippina</hi> was gone with the Hat, and with all the Iewels, he bitterly curſed the trée, the fruit, and him that planted it: ſaying moreover, curſed be the hour wherein I was born, and the days and hours that I have lived. O death, why hadſt thou not ſtrangled me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever I came into this miſerable danger &amp; diſtreſs, and ere ever I knew or beheld the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching beauty of <hi>Agrippina:</hi> would God my brother were with me in this wilderneſs, then would I ſurely ſtrangle him, and hang my ſelf: ſo that we being both dead, the purſe ſhould loſe his vertue, &amp; the falſe Queen, &amp; cruel <hi>Agrippina</hi> ſhould enjoy no further comodity nor pleaſure thereby.

Thus lay he all night as a deſperate man deſirous rather to dye than live any longer. When it was day, he aroſe &amp; walked every way, but could not hear nor ſee any man; and being very hungry, came at laſt unto a tree, whereon grew very fair red Apples, whereof as ſoon as he had eaten a couple, there ſprang out of his head two horns, like as it were of a Goat, which he could by no
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:151308:80"/> means get off. Then began he more inwardly to feel the vengeance of God, for his theft and whoredom before time committed, and asked mercy for his ſins, ſaying: O wretch that I am, O unhappieſt of all other men; thus mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly disfigured like a beaſt, for that I have beaſtly lived, and have not taken ſmall correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore patiently: Wherefore, O God Almighty, ſithence I am deprived of all mens help and ſuccour, forgive me my offences, take from me this deformity, and aſſiſt me in this extream calamity.</p>

Therefore we will ſend for Phyſitians, it cannot be but that they have found written by what ocaſion they grow, and how they may be conſumed away. <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi> with theſe words was comforted with ſome hope, willing them to keep all things ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and by privy means to learn if Phyſick might help her.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Old Chamberlain went with ſpeed to all the beſt Phyſitians, and told them: That whereas one of her Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred had two great Horns grown out of her Head, ſhe would know whether they could by Phyſick be taken away or not. The
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:151308:83"/> Phyſicians hearing of this ſtrange infirmity, were all deſirous to ſee the party. But the Gentlewoman ſaid, you muſt not in any caſe ſee her, except you will be bound in great bonds to take them clean away, which if you can do, you ſhall be richly rewarded. But there was none would take upon him to take away the growing of the horns, for they had never ſeen, heard, nor read of the like. When the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman thought that no remedy would be had, ſhe was returned home again to <hi>Agrippina</hi> with a heavy heart.</p>

            <p>AS ſhe was coming towards the Court, ſhe met with <hi>Andolocia,</hi> who being apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led like a Phyſitian in an ancient Gown, and disfigured with a counterfeit bottle-noſe, ſaid unto her: I perceive good Miſtris that you have been with three ſundry Phyſitians in my light, I pray you ſhew me, have you ſped of your purpoſe? Be not diſpleaſed that I am ſo bold to ask you this Queſtion, for I am a Phyſitian alſo: And if you have any grief, you may ſhew it me, for it muſt be a very ſtrange diſeaſe that I will not with Gods help cure and take from you. The Gentlewoman ſuppoſing that God had ſent this Phyſitian, which offered himſelf ſo luckely, ſaid: there is a marvellous impediment chanced to a Noble Gentlewoman, out of whoſe head are grown two horns of a Goat, which if you can take away, that they ſpring no more, you ſhall be richly rewarded, for ſhe hath money at will. The Phyſitian ſmiling, courteouſly ſaid, if that be the worſt, I have the ſcience to rid her of her horns without any pain or ſmart. I know well alſo the cauſe whereof they came. She earneſtly requeſted him to declare the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that ſtrange diſeaſe. He ſaid: She hath been unfaithful where ſhe profeſſed Love, and hath inwardly rejoyced at Wickedneſs done to her friend, which joy ſhe durſt not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly utter: howbeit, whereas it muſt needs in ſome place of the body have an iſſue, it is leaſt dangerous when it breaketh out upward: for if
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:151308:84"/> it ſhould not be expelled; it would ſo oppreſs the heart, that death would ſhortly enſue. It is not now two years ſithence that I was in the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Court, where an Earls Daughter of a fair and tender Complexion, had grown on her forehead two great Horns, which I by my ſcience, and Gods help took away.</p>
            <p>When the Chamberlain had now great hope of his cunning, ſhe asked where he lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying: that ſhe would preſently come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to him. He ſaid: I am lodged here-by, at the ſwan, there may you enquire for me; I am called the Doctor with the great Noſe; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have another Name, yet am I beſt known thereby, becauſe I am but a ſtranger. Then went ſhe joyfully unto the ſorrowful Princeſs, and ſaid: Gracious Lady, pluck up a merry heart, and be of good chear, you ſhall be ſhortly rid of your Horns; ſhewing unto her how when moſt of the <hi>London</hi> Phyſitians had ſent her away comfortleſs, ſhe met by chance with a ſtrange Doctor, who made light of the matter, and would warrant me to help your grief, for that he had taken away the like from an Earls Daughter of <hi>Spain</hi> before. Moreover he told me the cauſe whereof they did ſpring, which your grace doth well know, whereby I did the better believe him. Then ſaid <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi> why had you not brought him with you, ſéeing you know how earneſt I deſire to be cured? Go incontinently and fetch him hither,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:151308:84"/> and will him to bring all things neceſſary for the purpoſe, not ſparing any coſt. Take alſo with you to give him an hundred Crowns, and if he demand more, give him as much as he asketh. The Gentlewoman went to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, gave him an hundred Crowns, ſaying: I pray you be now diligent, and to the patient, that I ſhall bring you, muſt you come only by night, neither muſt you diſcloſe the matter to any perſon; for her own father and mother as yet know not of it. The Phyſitian ſaid: Doubt not you of my ſecretneſs: but before I go with you, I muſt buy at the Apothecaries ſuch things as are requiſite: in the mean time you may ſtay here, or return again two hours hence: ſhe ſaid, I will tarry for you, for I dare not go home without you.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:151308:85"/> The Phyſitian viewed and handled the horns, ſaying: You muſt have upon each horn a piece of rough Apes-skin, taken warm from the Ape, and with this confection will I anoint them alſo. There was an old Ape in the Court which was preſently ſlain, and the skin flayed off, of which were made two caſes, as the Phyſitian had commanded. Then did he annoint the horns and her temples with Apes-greaſe, and his ſweet confection, and put on the caſes of the skin, and ſaid to her: This have I done to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and mollifie the horns: but they muſt be brawn away by purging, for the which you ſhall ſwallow theſe ſmall Pills, and reſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, whereby you ſhall perceive a ſpeedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippina</hi> received the purgation, which was the Apple to drive away horns, cut in ſmall pieces, and mingled with rubarb. And although this counterfeit Phyſitian had uſed ſuch Apiſh Medicines to make a ſhew of rare cunning; yet was it the Apple indeed that only did the feat. <hi>Andolocia</hi> withdrawing himſelf a little aſide, the Rubarb began to work with his Patient, ſo that ſhe went twice or thrice to the Stool. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while came in the Doctor, and ſaid: Let us ſee whether the Phyſick hath done any good, and therewith he pulled off the skins, and the horns were alſo diminiſhed, whereof ſhe was exceeding glad. Then departed he, and ſaid, he would go to the Apothecaries again, and that the next night he could finiſh his cure.
<pb facs="tcp:151308:85"/> When he had tempered the other Apple with Sugar and Spice of another relliſh, he came the next night unto her again, and dreſſed her as he had done before, but gave her not ſo much of the Apple, becauſe ſhe ſhould not be throughly cured, before he had talked with her, and had ſome likelihood to bring his purpoſe to paſs. Wherefore as he ſat by her, ſhe being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, he thought with himſelf, two or thrée thouſand Crowns were a ſufficient reward if another had done this cure, but it is nothing comparable to the miſchief ſhe hath done unto me; wherefore before I clean take away the horns, I will let her underſtand my mind, to the which if ſhe will not conſent, where ſhe thinks to be rid of her horns, I will cauſe them to grow ſo long as they were before; and then I will go into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and from thence ſend her word, that if ſhe will have remedy, ſhe ſhall come unto me, and bring with her the wiſhing-Hat and Purſe. As he was thus deviſing, came in the Gentlewoman with a candle to ſee <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi> who was aſleep,</p>

            <head>How <hi>Andolocia</hi> by chance found the Wiſhing-Hat. Chap. 40.</head>
            <p>IT chanced that <hi>Andolocias</hi> Cap fell from his head, ſo that when he ſtooped to take it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he eſpied his wiſhing-hat lying under the bed on the ground, which none regarded, for
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:151308:86"/> they knew not the vertue of it: neither knew the Princeſs her ſelf, that by the means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe was conveyed out of the Court, and from the Deſart; for if ſhe had, it ſhould not have been ſo negligently laid up. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian then ſent the Gentlewoman for ſome Conduit Water; and in the mean while he took it up from under the Bed, and held it pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily under his Gown. By this time was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina</hi> awaked, then took he the skin from her Brow, to ſée how much the Horns were ſunk, which were now become very ſlender, and ſcant an handful long, whereof <hi>Agrippina</hi> was very glad. And whereas <hi>Andolocia</hi> meant to have rough and ſharp Communion with <hi>Agrippina,</hi> he was now ſomewhat paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when he had the Hat, and in Courteous manner ſaid unto her: Gracious Lady, you ſee that your malady is now well-diminiſhed, the chiefeſt cure that reſteth behind, is to drive the root of the Horns out of the skul, to the which muſt be uſed very coſtly medicines, which if I cannot find in this Realm, I muſt needs ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go my ſelf, or ſend ſome other Doctor to fetch ſuch things whereof I ſhall inform him, in other Countries; which will ask great charges. Beſides this, would I know what certain ſum of money you will give me, when you ſhall be clean rid of your Horns, and that your forehead ſhall be as ſmooth as ever it was. The Princeſs anſwered, I have certainly found that your ſcience is exxellent and true,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:151308:86"/> therefore I beſeech you to do your beſt to help me, and ſpare no money. The Phyſitian ſaid: You bid me not to ſpare, but I have no money, whereof I ſhould be liberal. For <hi>Agrippina</hi> (as naturally all Women be more nigardly than men) was careful in ſparing, though ſhe had a Purſe which could not be empty. Howbeit when he craved her liberality ſo plainly, ſhe went to her Coffer and brought out the Purſe, hanging it at her girdle, wherein were alſo her beſt Iewels; the ſame ſhe tyed about her middle, and went to the Window, where ſhe counted out three hundred Crowns. When <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolocia</hi> perceived ſhe had the Purſe and Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els about her, he groped under his Gown, as though he ſought for a Purſe to put his money in, caſt off his Cap, ſet on his Hat, claſped <hi>Agrippina</hi> faſt about the middle, and wiſhed himſelf in a ſolitary Deſart, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently accompliſhed by the vertue of the Hat. When <hi>Agrippina</hi> was thus ſuddenly gone, the Gentlewoman of the Chamber ran to the Quéen, and told her that a Phyſician had carried away her daughter in ſuch ſort as the Merchant had done, and declared what had chanced concerning the Horns. The Quéen with this heavy news was aſtonied: but yet hoped that ſhe would quickly return, as ſhe had done before the other time. But when ſhe came not again after one day and a night paſt ſhe was exceeding ſorrowful, and recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the KING alſo, how ſtrangely
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:151308:87"/> all things had chanced, and how the Phyſitian had conveyed her away.</p>
            <p>The King ſaid, he is indeed a wiſe Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and hath I warrant you more knowledge than the common ſort: It is none other then <hi>Andolocia,</hi> whom you have falſly deceived. For it is no other like but he that gave unto him ſuch a Purſe, hath given him ſuch Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alſo, when he ſhould loſe it, to recover it again. It is the will of God that he only ſhould enjoy the Purſe, and none elſe; like as his pleaſure is that I ſhould be only King of this Realm: would God therefore that we had but our Daughter again, and with the Purſe well might he ſpeed that hath moſt Right thereto.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Quéen, let us ſend forth Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers into every coaſt, to hear of her if it may be, leſt ſhe come to ſome poverty and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The King ſaid, it were in vain to ſeek her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til God reſtore her againe and alſo it were a ſhame for us that we have kept her no better. But when <hi>Andolocia</hi> and <hi>Agrippina</hi> were alone in the deſart, he caſt off the Doctors Gown, and plucked away his counterfeit great noſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe perceived it was <hi>Andolocia,</hi> to whom ſhe could not yet ſpeak for ſhame &amp; fear, for that he looked on her with ſuch an angry &amp; grim coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as though he would have preſently kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her. And firſt he drew a knife, and cutting her girdle aſunder, took the purſe, and faſtned it
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:151308:87"/> to his Doublet where it was before, whereat <hi>Agrippina</hi> trembled and quaked with great fear. Then ſaid <hi>Andoloc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How could thy Heart ſerve thée (thou Perjured Wight) to ſhew ſuch unkindneſs towards me, who committed unto thée both my ſecrets, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and goods, and ſo often adventured my ſelf to juſt, and to uſe other feats of Chivalry only for thy ſake? For recompence whereof thou wroughteſt me ſuch miſchief, and broughteſt me into ſuch deſperate miſery, that if God of his grace had not comforted me, I had ſurely deſtroyed my body, and thereby damned my ſoul. Now be thine own judge, whether it be reaſon that I take as little pitty on thee, as thou haſt done on me,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippina</hi> diſtilling many tears, lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaid: O vertuous and valiant Knight, I confeſs that I have done diſhoneſtly, and have intollerably abuſed you: yet notwithſtanding have ſome compaſſion on me, and conſider the frailneſs aod ignorance that is naturally in Women more than in Men, and do good for evil, as it becometh a Chriſtian, Vertuous and valiant Knight. <hi>Andolocia</hi> anſwered: but the miſery and ſhame that I have ſuſtained by thée, went ſo near my heart, that I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Forget or Forgive. Then ſaid ſhe again:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:151308:88"/> yet <hi>Andolocia</hi> for the love of God adviſe your ſelf, what diſhonour it would be for you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge your Wrath on a poor Woman, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with you as a Priſoner in the Deſart, the report whereof you may ſuppoſe would be a great blemiſh unto your Noble Chivalry. Then ſaid <hi>Andolocia:</hi> Well <hi>Agrippina,</hi> though thou deſerve no mercy, yet will I reſtrain from tyranny, and do promiſe thé by my Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that I will neither diſtain thy honour, nor hurt thy body. But thou haſt one token on thy head, which thou ſhalt carry with thée to thy Grave, that thou mayeſt the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy unfaithfulneſs towards thy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Agrippina</hi> being glad that ſhe had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Violence or Death, thanked him, and therewith ſaid: Now would God my Horns were away, and I were again in my Fathers Palace. <hi>Andolocia</hi> hearing her begin to wiſh, ſuddenly caught up the Hat, that lay not far from her, and held it faſt in his hand: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Agrippina</hi> perceived that he greatly eſtéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Hat, and that by vertue of it ſhe was thrice conveyed, whereat ſhe was inwardly vexed, that ſhe had eſtéemed and kept the Hat no better. But ſhe earneſtly entreated <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolocia</hi> that he would clean rid her of her Horns, and convey her again to her Father.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:151308:88"/> ſo near thy Fathers Palace, that thou mayeſt ſée it; but I mean my ſelf not to come no more there. She requeſted him again twice or thrice, to deliver her of her Horns, but he was fully determined not to grant her requeſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Andolocia</hi> ſaid: Gracious Lord to pleaſure your Majeſty and your Son, I will travel in the matter, and will cauſe her in ſhort ſpace to be brought again into her Fathers Palace. The King required him to do it, and to ſpare no charges, promiſing to conſider him well for his travel, and largely to requite his courteſſe, if he could bring it to paſs. <hi>Andolocia</hi> ſaid: let
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:151308:91"/> your Grace appoint a Noble Embaſſage, and let them be ſent fourtéen days after me into <hi>England,</hi> and they ſhall find her at <hi>London</hi> in her Fathers Palace: It were alſo expedient that there were alſo a Lively Picture drawn of the young Prince, which the Ambaſſadors may ſhew unto the King and Quéen, whereof they cannot but like very well, if it be truly and cunningly limned.

               <p>The young Prince alſo requeſted <hi>Andolocia</hi> to be diligent in the matter, for that he was greatly deſtrous to ſée her, having heard ſo great commendation of her beauty: <hi>Andolocia</hi> promiſed both the King and his Son, to do his beſt: and ſo taking his leave of them, went to <hi>Famagoſta,</hi> there borrowed he the wiſhing hat of his brother, &amp; willing his ſteward to let his men be well uſed, &amp; to want for nothing that was expedient for them in his abſence: ſaying; that he would very ſhortly return: wert out of ſight, ſet the hat on his head, &amp; wiſhed himſelf in the wilderneſs, where the Apples were that would procure and take away horns, where he found the trées laden with Apples. Now wiſt he not certainly which was the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: howbeit at all adventure he taſted of the one trée, &amp; there preſently ſprang horns on his head. After that he did eat the Apples of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; the horns vaniſhed away. So took he of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:151308:91"/> both ſorts with him, and from thence convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf unto the Abby in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he knocked, and was let in to ſpeak with the Lady Abbeſſe; of whom he required licenſe to talk ſecretly with <hi>Agrippina.</hi> The Abbeſſe knowing him very well, called <hi>Agrippina</hi> unto him; who when ſhe ſaw <hi>Andolocia,</hi> looked on him with a ſtrange countenance, not knowing the intent of his coming, and therefore was ſomewhat afraid. <hi>Andolocia</hi> taking her a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aſide, ſaid unto her: Lady <hi>Agrippina,</hi> tell me, if you were now rid of your horns, where would you wiſh to be? <hi>Agrippina</hi> ſaid: You may well ſuppoſe that I would then long to be with the King my Father, and the Queen my dear Mother. Then ſaid <hi>Andolocia,</hi> God hath heard thy Prayer <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and thou ſhalt obtain thy deſire: with that he gave her an Apple, and willed her to eat it, and reſt thereupon a while, and when ſhe did riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, her Horns ſhould be clean conſumed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. <hi>Agrippina</hi> did as ſhe was willed, and when ſhe awake, ſhe felt that all was well, wherewith it is to be thought the did not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rejoyce.</p>
               <p>Then called ſhe her waiting-maid, to help to comb and trim her head, which being done, ſhe came before the Abbeſſe, who marvelled greatly to ſee ſuch a ſudden change; and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her Ladies to behold her alſo; they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred likewiſe that ſhe was become ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſo clean rid of the Horns, as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:151308:92"/> there remained no ſign of them; wherefore they all ſang praiſe to God for his miracle ſhewed. Then ſaid <hi>Andolocia: Agrippina</hi> is a Princeſs of a Kings Linage; I muſt now take her from you, and carry her to her Father and Mother again, and before a month be ended ſhe ſhall be married to a young King, being of a fair and comely perſonage, as likely to be ſeen. <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locia</hi> gave unto the Abbeſſe and her company an hundred Crowns, and thanked them for their gentle entertainment and uſage of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina:</hi> ſhe her ſelf alſo gave them moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous thanks.

When the Queen perceived that they had almoſt determined of the matter, it grieved her that her Daughter ſhould be carried ſo far into a ſtrange country, and to be married to one of whoſe demeanour, favour, and perſonage, ſhe was altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. Then required the Embaſſadors that the Queen might come in preſence, to whom they ſhewed that painted Portraicture of the young Prince, affirming with an oath, that the perſon whom that picture did repreſent, was rather more amiable than the Image did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and that he was but four &amp; twenty years of age. With this they were all pleaſed, and the Quéen, who took the picture and brought it to <hi>Agrippina,</hi> ſhewing it to her, and how they had determined to marry her unto a young King, which was more beautiful than the Picture could ſhew. <hi>Agrippina</hi> remembring the words of <hi>Andolocia</hi> in the Abbey, gave the more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and granted her conſent, that what her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Queen ſhould do in that behalf, ſhe would be obedient thereto.</p>

And when he could by no means hear tell what was become of his Brother, he conceived thereby ſuch an inward grief, that for thought he fell ſick, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after ended his life.</p>
            <p>The King had cauſed Proclamation to be made, that whoſoever could bring word whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Andolocia</hi> were dead or alive, he ſhould have a thouſand Duckats in ready money, but no tidings could be heard of him. Then the Earl of <hi>Limoſe</hi> took his leave of the King, and departed home to his Caſtle, where he found <hi>Andolocia</hi> in a deep dungeon. When <hi>Andolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> ſaw him, he was glad, beſeeching him to be merciful unto him, and to deliver him out of priſon; for (ſaid he) I wot not whoſe priſoner I am, neither for what cauſe I am thus ſtraitly penned up: if I hade done wrong to any man, I
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:151308:95"/> will recompence it either with body or goods. The Earl ſaid: <hi>Andolocia,</hi> thou art not brought hither to be delivered again, thou art my priſoner, and before thou depart ſhalt thou tell me how and from whence thou hadſt to much money, to maintain ſuch a ſumptuous and Princely Port, as thou haſt ſo long time done, or elſe I will ſo torment thee, that thou ſhalt be glad to ſhew it. When <hi>Andolocia</hi> heard thoſe cruel and threatning words, he was exceedingly afraid, his hope failed him, and he wiſt not how to diſſemble the matter, but ſaid on a ſuddain: My Father when he died, ſhewed me a Privy which is in our Houſe at <hi>Famagoſta,</hi> wherein I ſhould find more money than I were able to ſpend during my Life: and if it pleaſe you to carry me as a Priſoner thither, I will ſhew you the experience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Earl would not be perſwaded that this was the truth, but took him out of the Stocks, and racked him grievouſly, which he a while endured, but at the length he was ſo bitterly tormented, that he might no longer refrain, but ſhewed plainly the vertue of the Purſe. When the Earl heard that, he took the Purſe of him, and by trial finding his ſaying to be true, cauſed <hi>Andolocia</hi> to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſet in the Stocks, and committed him to one whom he truſted well.</p>
            <p>The Earl then paid his Debts, ſtored his Caſtle with victuals and furniture, and rode forthwith to his Companion the Earl <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:151308:96"/> who rejoyced at his coming to the court. And when they had communed together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the purſe that the Earl had gotten of <hi>Andolocia</hi> by racking, there was no ſmall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing between them on either part. But <hi>Theodorus</hi> liked not that <hi>Andolocia</hi> was left alive: For (ſaid he) I hear it reported in the Court, that he is a Doctor in Negromancy, and can fly in the Ayr: Therefore it is to be feared that he will by ſome means eſcape, whereby we may both come in Danger of death. But the Earl ſaid, he lieth ſo faſt &amp; ſure in Priſon, that I warrant you he cannot come forth. Then went they together and took out as much money as they liſted, and were both alike deſirous to have the purſe: but to eſchew all controverſie, they agreed that one ſhould have it one half year,, and the other ſhould have it another half: and that whoſo had the purſe, ſhould not ſuffer the other to want, or remain in danger: and that foraſmuch as the Count of <hi>Limoſe</hi> was the elder, he ſhould firſt enjoy it, The two elders having now money at will, yet were they circumſpect, and durſt not ſeem very liberal or waſtful, for fear of ſuſpition. But <hi>Theodorus</hi> could not be yet ſatisfied, as long as <hi>Andolocia</hi> was alive, for dread leſt they ſhould again loſe the purſe. Beſides that, he purpoſed when he had the poſſeſſion of the purſe, to go ſo far with it, that he would be ſafe and ſure both from the King and the Earl of <hi>Limoſe.</hi> And therefore he entreated of the

Then took the Lord <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> his leave of the King, and ſaid, he would travel to ſee the pleaſant commodity of his Dominion. Then rode he ſtraight unto the Priſon to <hi>Andolocia,</hi> whoſe legs were rotted with the ſtocks and irons, but now he hoped that ſithence they had his Purſe, they took no more regard of him, but ſuppoſed that the Earl had ſent <hi>Theodorus</hi> to let him out of Priſon.</p>

            <p>BVt the Earl <hi>Theodorus</hi> ſaid unto him: tell me <hi>Andolocia,</hi> hoſt thou any more ſuch Purſes as thou haſt given to the Earl of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſe?</hi> If thou haſt the like beſtow it on me, and I will preſently let thee go free: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: Gracious Lord, ſo God help me, I have no more, but if I had, it were at your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. Then ſaid <hi>Theodorus:</hi> It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that thou art skilful in Negromancy, and can flie in the Air: Why doſt thou not now practiſe thy Cunning to deliver thee from hence? He ſaid: My good Lord, I neither have, nor never had, any pleaſure in that Art; but have only had my pleaſure with the Purſe which ye have, the ſame will I freely give to you and the Earl of <hi>Limoſe,</hi> before God and the world, and will never make claim to it again, if you will for the Honour of God, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me poor wretched man out of this priſon, leſt I die here miſerably.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodorus</hi> ſaid: Canſt thou now ſubmit thy ſelf? Why waſt thou not ſo lowly, when with ſuch Pride and Preſumption thou didſt advance thy ſelf before the King and the Queen to diſhonour us all? Where are all the fair Ladies whom thou didſt ſo well pleaſe, and which gave thee all the praiſe? Try now if any of them can help thee: but ſithence thou doeſt ſo ſore long to be out of Priſon, I will ſoon deliver thee from thy ſorrow. Then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered he five hundred Duckats unto the Kéeper to ſtrangle <hi>Andolocia,</hi> but he would not do it,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:151308:97"/> ſaying: He is an honeſt man, and very freble, ſo that he muſt needs ere it be long die of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but I ſurely will not commit ſuch a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſin. Then ſaid <hi>Theodorus:</hi> Give me a Halter, and I will Strangle him; but the Keeper would not in any caſe help him. Then took he his girdle that was about his middle, and caſting of it about <hi>Andolocias</hi> neck, with his Dagger writhed in it, and ſo ſtrangled poor <hi>Andolocia</hi> to death, ſitting in the ſtocks, and gave the Keeper a reward to convey the dead body out of fight. When this cruel tyrant had finiſhed this horrid murther, he incontinently departed again to the Court, where he ſecretly told unto the Earl of <hi>Limoſe</hi> what he had done: ſaying; <hi>Andolocia</hi> is like to work us no more miſchief, for I have killed him with mine own hands, neither could I reſt before I was ſure that he was dead. Now whereas the Earl in four days ſpace had not medled with the purſe, and the half year was expired that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> turn came to enjoy it as long, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to deliver it, and take as much ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money as he would. The Earl of <hi>Limoſe</hi> was well content, and went forthwith to the Coffer, and brought forth the Purſe, caſting it upon the Table. <hi>Theodorus</hi> took it in his hand, and would have Coyned out ſome money, but there was none to be felt, neither would the Purſe yield any more fruit. Then looked they ſtrangely one on the other, not knowing that by Reaſon that <hi>Ampedo</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:151308:98"/> and <hi>Andolocia</hi> were both dead, the Purſe had loſt his vertue. Then the Earl <hi>Theodorus</hi> ſaid angerly: Thou falſe and deceitful man, thinkeſt thou ſo fondly to deceive me? by delivering unto me this ſimple Purſe that is not worth a groat, inſtead of that pretious Purſe whereof we had ſo much money? fetch me therefore that which <hi>I</hi> now ought to have. He anſwered: It is in good faith the ſame Purſe that I took from <hi>Andolocia,</hi> neither have I any other: but how it comes to paſs that it yieldeth not as it bid before, I know not. <hi>Theodorus</hi> would not be pacified with this Anſwer, but was far more angry, and ſaid he would be revenged on him whatever befel, and therewith drawing his Rapier, ſtrook at him. The Earl of <hi>Limoſe</hi> having no other defence, ran within him, and ſtaid his hands as ſoon as he might, whereby they made ſuch a noiſe, that their men being in the next Chamber, brake up the Doors, and parted them. Howbeit the Earl of <hi>Limoſe</hi> was deadly wounded therefore his men laid hold on <hi>Theodorus.</hi> When tidings came to the King, that the Earls which were great friends, had fought in a Chamber, and one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſlain the other, he commanded both to be brought before him, to enquire the cauſe of their debate; but <hi>Theodorus</hi> only was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the other being ſo wounded, that he could not come.</p>

            <p>WHen the King by ſtrict Examination and grievous Racking, had violently forc'd <hi>Theodorus</hi> to confeſs how they had dealt with <hi>Andolocia,</hi> he was excéedingly grieved, &amp; being mov'd with wrathful diſpleaſure againſt the murtherers, without longer deliberation, he gave judgement, that they ſhould be execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bruiſing their bones upon wheels, and that if the Earl of <hi>Limoſe</hi> were ſick, he ſhould be carried to the place of execution, and if he were dead, that his carkaſs notwithſtanding ſhould be ſet on the wheel, which was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:151308:99"/> on the two Earls, as the King had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Then ſent the King alſo certain Officers to the Caſtle of <hi>Limoſe,</hi> to ſeize upon all the goods and lands of the Earl; and willed alſo that as many men and women as were in the caſtle, conſenting to the murther, or that had concealed the ſame, ſhould be all hanged out upon the Caſtle walls without any mercy. And whereas they had knowledge how the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Andolocia</hi> was caſt into a ditch by the Caſtle, they cauſed it to be taken up, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to <hi>Famagoſta,</hi> where it was honourably buried in the Chantry Church, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had founded; for whom the King and the Queen, and the Prince, and Princeſs mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if he had been of their near Linage. And foraſmuch as neither <hi>Ampedo</hi> nor <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locia</hi> had any Heirs left behind them, the King took the Coſtly Palace into his Poſſeſſion, wherein he found ſo much goods and ready coin, ſuch ſumptuous houſhold-ſtuff, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and coſtly Iewels, that it might rather ſeem the Palace of ſome mighty Emperour, than of a Subject. In the ſame Palace the young King and Queen held their Court, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his Father departed out of this life; and then began they to reign and govern the whole Realm of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
